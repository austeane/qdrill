# Use pnpm Instead of npm

This project uses pnpm as the package manager. Always use `pnpm` commands instead of `npm`:

- Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `pnpm run build` instead of `npm run build`
- Use `pnpm add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`

For actually running though do 
vercel dev


Check the project root for `pnpm-lock.yaml` which confirms this is a pnpm project.
