# 500 Error Debug Documentation

## Issue Description
Getting 500 Internal Server Error when navigating to:
- `/teams/[teamId]/season/sections`
- `/teams/[teamId]/season/markers`

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Created Files
- `/src/routes/teams/[teamId]/season/sections/+page.server.js`
- `/src/routes/teams/[teamId]/season/sections/+page.svelte`
- `/src/routes/teams/[teamId]/season/markers/+page.server.js`
- `/src/routes/teams/[teamId]/season/markers/+page.svelte`

### 2. Modified Files
- `/src/lib/components/season/SeasonTimeline.svelte`
  - Fixed marker rendering (changed from `markers.all` to `markers`)
  - Fixed marker properties (from `start_date/end_date/title` to `date/name`)
  - Added `teamId` prop for navigation links
- `/src/routes/teams/[teamId]/season/+page.svelte`
  - Added `teamId` prop to SeasonTimeline component
  - Updated button colors for visual distinction

### 3. Toast Library Fix
- Changed import from `svelte-sonner` to `@zerodevx/svelte-toast`
- Updated all toast calls from `toast.error()` to `toast.push()` with theme

## Assumptions Made

1. **Database Access**: Assumed `query` function from `$lib/server/db` works the same as in other pages
2. **Authentication**: Assumed `locals.user` would be available from Auth.js session
3. **Team Permissions**: Used same pattern as other team pages for permission checking
4. **API Endpoints**: Assumed existing season API endpoints work correctly

## Things Tried

1. ✅ Created the missing route files
2. ✅ Fixed import issues (svelte-sonner → @zerodevx/svelte-toast)
3. ✅ Ran `pnpm run check` to identify issues
4. ✅ Ran `pnpm exec svelte-kit sync` to regenerate routes
5. ✅ Restarted the dev server
6. ✅ Verified files were generated in `.svelte-kit/output/server`
7. ✅ Checked that build completes successfully
8. ✅ Changed auth handling from `error(401)` to `redirect(303, '/login')`
9. ✅ Changed to use services instead of direct DB queries
10. ✅ Fixed service method names (getSectionsBySeason → getSeasonSections)
11. ❌ Still getting 500 error when not authenticated

## Things Ruled Out

1. **Build Issues**: Build completes successfully, files are generated
2. **Import Issues**: Fixed the toast library import issue
3. **Missing Routes**: Routes are properly registered in SvelteKit manifest
4. **Client-Side Issues**: Error happens server-side during SSR

## Things It Could Still Be

1. **Authentication Flow Issue**: The error might be happening because:
   - The page requires authentication (`locals.user`)
   - But returns 500 instead of 401/302 redirect
   - Possibly the `locals.user` check is failing in an unexpected way

2. **Database Connection Issue**: 
   - The `query` function might not be properly initialized
   - Connection string might be missing in dev environment
   - The pool might not be created correctly

3. **Import Path Issue in Generated Files**:
   - The generated server file imports from `../../../../../../chunks/db.js`
   - This might be resolving incorrectly

4. **Middleware/Hook Issue**:
   - Something in `hooks.server.js` might be interfering
   - The auth middleware might not be populating `locals.user`

5. **Server-Side Rendering Issue**:
   - The +page.svelte might have SSR-incompatible code
   - Window/document references without proper guards

## Debugging Steps to Try Next

1. **Add Console Logging**: Add console.log at the start of +page.server.js to see if it's reached
2. **Check Database Connection**: Test if `query` function works in a simpler endpoint
3. **Simplify the Page**: Remove all database queries and just return static data
4. **Check Auth Flow**: Verify `locals.user` is being populated correctly
5. **Check Server Logs**: Look for actual error message in server console

## Best Guess

**Most likely cause**: The redirect is not working properly in the server-side load function, or there's an issue with the service imports/calls.

After investigation, the issue appears to be:
1. User is not authenticated (no session cookie)
2. The page correctly tries to redirect with `throw redirect(303, '/login')`
3. However, something in the redirect handling or service layer is failing
4. The services exist and method names are correct, but the error persists

**Possible remaining issues**:
1. The `/login` route might not exist (should be handled by Auth.js)
2. The redirect might be conflicting with SvelteKit's internal routing
3. The services might be throwing an error during initialization
4. There might be a circular dependency issue

**Next steps to debug**:
1. Add console.log at the very start of the load function to see if it's reached
2. Try a simpler redirect like `throw redirect(303, '/')`
3. Remove all service calls and just return static data
4. Check if `/login` route exists and is properly configured
