**(9:45) TC Strategic One Runs**

**(10 min/9:45) General Strategic Intro**

* Introduce some basic strategic concepts so that we can build on them in our next practices  
* Looking to build chemistry and try new things (our offense needs to improve from previously)  
* Defense has two bludgers in all scenarios  
* Focused on “standard” defenses (no aggressive positioning or presses)  
  * Use hoop and 2-2 as defensive formations

* **General Offensive Notes**  
  * Chasers  
    * Basic intro to box and kite formations  
    * **Try to be coordinated and deliberate to start offense**  
      * Have an initial plan to shift defense  
      * Eg: pick on keeper from right  
      * Eg: get the ball deep and try to draw defense out  
      * Eg: fake handoff then pass back to center of kite  
    * **Use resets and consider reset passes as a success**  
    * **Take space before passing**  
      * Forces defensive shifts and commitment  
  * Beaters  
    * Goal is always to score, never recovery  
    * 80% free beater helps chasers attack, loaded beater protects ball carrier  
    * 15% loaded beater helps with very low risk  
      * Tap beats, fakes, protecting deep chaser  
      * Throws back when pressured  
    * 5% using our bludger to help offense  
      * Throw bludger at opposing beater from behind their hoops  
    * 0% throw our bludger at defensive beaters from in front

**(10 min/9:55) Hoop Defense**

* Outline hoop defense  
  * Only with 2 bludgers  
  * Keeper on keeper line  
  * Beaters in between hoops  
  * Beaters are initial pressure when ball is rotated behind hoops  
  * Do we rotate chaser out to ball as well? Or only beater?  
  * Does keeper stay near keeper line or rotate to hoops?  
* Run free form offense

**(30 min/10:05) Attacking VS Hoop**

* Concept 1 (patience)  
  * Box  
  * Hard passes around hoops  
  * Pass deep, back to top, across to support, deep, back to support  
  * Everyone begins taking space when they have the ball then passes to a safe option  
* Concept 2 (Ball-carrier initiated offense)  
  * Box  
  * Loaded beater protects a deep chaser who is passed the ball  
  * Support chaser looks to cut or pick at near side hoop  
  * take space from behind and attack  
* Concept 3 (wing initiated offense)  
  * Kite  
  * Coordinate which sides beaters attack and attack same side  
  * A support chaser picks the keeper  
  * Deep chaser picks side hoop or is open for cut

**(10 min/10:35) 2-2 Defense**

* Outline 2-2 defense  
  * Can cheat away from hoops when ball is not in a scorable position  
  * Beater closes out to deep pass, chaser follows for pick up  
  * Defense “flips” to face wherever the ball is  
* Run free form offense

**(30 min/10:45) Attacking vs 2-2**

* Concept 1 (patience)  
  * Box  
  * Hard passes around hoops  
  * Pass deep, back to top, across to support, deep, back to support  
  * Everyone begins taking space when they have the ball then passes to a safe option  
  * Against a 2-2 we need the support chasers and beater to actively ensure the reset passes are easily available  
* Concept 2  
  * Kite  
  * “pop” play  
  * Loaded beater taps the non-keeper point defender  
  * Ball carrier takes space and passes to now uncovered support chaser  
  * One beater recovers bludger, other harasses near side beater (goal is to block the beat)  
  * Drive with goal to dunk or pass to behind the hoops cutter  
  * This play also has a box version, can mix it up  
* Concept 3  
  * Kite  
  * Decide side for free beater to harass  
  * Fake drive and handoff on opposite side of beater  
  * Drive toward remaining point defender  
  * Support chaser either picks point defender or cuts to hoop  
  * Wing chaser either picks hoop defender or provides a safe passing option behind hoops

**(15 min/11:15) Buffer**

**(11:30) Scrimmages**

* 3 8-minute scrimmages  
* 2 quaffle period scenarios  
* 1 SOP in range scenario
