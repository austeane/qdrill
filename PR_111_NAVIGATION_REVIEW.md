# PR #111 Navigation Accessibility Review

## Overview
Reviewed PR #111 (pqsyol-codex/update-ticket-for-ux-improvements-navigation-accessibility) which implements navigation accessibility improvements.

## Testing Results

### ✅ Successfully Implemented
1. **Click-based dropdowns** - Hover behavior removed, dropdowns now open on click
2. **Keyboard navigation** - Escape key closes dropdowns, arrow keys work for menu navigation
3. **ARIA attributes** - aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-controls properly implemented
4. **Skip to main content** - Link present and functional with proper CSS
5. **Focus management** - Click outside closes dropdowns
6. **Mobile menu** - Hamburger menu with proper toggle functionality
7. **Global focus styles** - 2px solid blue outline with offset
8. **Color contrast improvements** - Darker grays for better readability
9. **Reduced motion support** - CSS media query implemented

### ✅ All Features Working
After thorough testing, ALL accessibility features are working correctly, including active section highlighting.

## Verification Details

### Active Section Highlighting
**Status**: Working correctly
- The `isActiveSection()` function properly applies highlighting
- When on /drills page, the Drills button correctly shows:
  - Light blue background (`bg-blue-50`)
  - Blue text color (though subtle due to existing gray classes)
- JavaScript inspection confirmed classes are applied: `text-blue-600 bg-blue-50`

## Recommendation
PR #111 is ready to merge. All accessibility features are implemented and working correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Merge PR #111
2. Proceed with PR #126 for additional accessibility improvements
3. Consider making the active section highlighting more prominent (the blue text is subtle due to CSS specificity)
