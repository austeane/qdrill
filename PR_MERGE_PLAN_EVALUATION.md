3. `codex/conduct-accessibility-review` - Accessibility improvements
4. `codex/add-ux-improvements-for-unauthenticated-plan` - UX for unauthenticated users
5. `codex/implement-ux-improvements-for-search-experience` - Search UX improvements
6. `codex/reduce-linter-errors-safely` - Linter error reduction
7. `codex/remove-unused-stores` - Removes unused stores

## Critical Issues in the Original Plan

### 1. PR References Mismatch
**Issue**: The plan references PRs by numbers (#133, #136, etc.) but most branches don't have associated PR numbers visible. This makes it difficult to map the plan to actual branches.

**Improvement**: Create a mapping table between PR numbers and branch names, or update the plan to use branch names directly.

### 2. Conflict Between PRs #133 and #136
**Issue**: The plan mentions a critical conflict between these PRs regarding dragManager.js and sectionsStore.js modifications.

**Current Status**: Unable to locate these specific PRs. They may have been renamed or the conflict may have been resolved.

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify if these PRs still exist
- If they don't exist, update the plan to remove this conflict
- If they exist under different names, update the references

### 3. Component Deletion Conflict (SkeletonLoader)
**Issue**: PR #125 wants to delete SkeletonLoader.svelte, but PR #112 enhances it.

**Analysis**: 
- The `codex/implement-loading-states-for-ux-improvements` branch adds skeleton loaders
- The `codex/remove-unused-components` branch might be trying to delete it

**Recommendation**: 
1. Merge loading states implementation first
2. Review remove-unused-components to ensure it doesn't delete actively used components
3. Add a pre-merge check to scan for component usage

## Improved Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Immediate)
1. **Create PR Mapping Document**
   ```bash
   # Create a mapping of all branches to PR numbers
   git branch -r | grep codex/ > branch-list.txt
   # Manually map these to PR numbers if they exist
   ```

2. **Verify Critical Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check for actual conflicts between branches
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/codex/remove-unused-components
   git merge --abort
   # Repeat for each branch to identify conflicts
   ```

### Phase 2: Safe Merges First (Day 1-2)
Merge branches with no conflicts or dependencies:

1. **Accessibility Review**
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/codex/conduct-accessibility-review
   # Run accessibility tests
   # If passes, merge
   ```

2. **Linter Error Reduction**
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/codex/reduce-linter-errors-safely
   pnpm run lint
   # Verify no functional changes
   # Merge if safe
   ```

### Phase 3: Coordinated Component Changes (Day 3-4)
Handle the component deletion conflict:

1. **First: Merge Loading States**
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/codex/implement-loading-states-for-ux-improvements
   # Test all loading states
   # Document which components are now in use
   ```

2. **Then: Review and Update Component Removal**
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/codex/remove-unused-components
   # Update to exclude components used by loading states
   # Run usage analysis
   grep -r "ComponentName" src/
   ```

### Phase 4: Store and State Management (Day 5-7)
1. **Remove Unused Stores**
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/codex/remove-unused-stores
   # Verify no components import these stores
   # Check for dynamic imports
   ```

### Phase 5: UX Improvements (Day 8-10)
Merge remaining UX improvements in order of impact:

1. Search experience improvements
2. Unauthenticated user improvements
3. Any remaining UX branches

## Enhanced Safety Measures

### 1. Pre-Merge Validation Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-merge-check.sh

BRANCH=$1
echo "Checking branch: $BRANCH"

# Check for conflicts
git merge --no-commit --no-ff $BRANCH > /dev/null 2>&1
CONFLICTS=$?
git merge --abort 2>/dev/null

if [ $CONFLICTS -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Branch has conflicts with main"
    exit 1
fi

# Run tests
pnpm run test:unit:run
pnpm run lint
pnpm run check

# Check for deleted files still in use
git diff main..$BRANCH --name-status | grep "^D" | while read status file; do
    echo "Checking if $file is still referenced..."
    grep -r $(basename $file) src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
done
```

### 2. Component Usage Analyzer
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# component-usage.sh

COMPONENT=$1
echo "Analyzing usage of $COMPONENT"

# Check imports
grep -r "import.*$COMPONENT" src/

# Check dynamic imports
grep -r "import(.*$COMPONENT" src/

# Check string references
grep -r "'.*$COMPONENT" src/
grep -r '".*$COMPONENT' src/
```

### 3. Merge Tracking Dashboard
Create a simple tracking system:
```markdown
# Merge Progress Tracker

| Branch | PR # | Status | Conflicts | Tests Pass | Merged Date |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| codex/remove-unused-components | ? | Pending | Check SkeletonLoader | ? | - |
| codex/implement-loading-states-for-ux-improvements | ? | Pending | None | ? | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Risk Mitigation Improvements

### 1. Automated Rollback Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-merge.sh

COMMIT_HASH=$1
echo "Rolling back to commit: $COMMIT_HASH"

# Create backup branch
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Rollback
git reset --hard $COMMIT_HASH
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Notify team
echo "Rollback complete. Previous state saved in backup branch"
```

### 2. Health Check Monitoring
Add monitoring after each merge:
- API response times
- Error rates
- User session stability
- Build success rates

### 3. Staged Deployment Strategy
Instead of merging directly to main:
1. Merge to staging branch
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Run automated tests
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. If stable, merge to main

## Communication Improvements

### 1. Daily Merge Report Template
```markdown
# Daily Merge Report - [Date]

## Merged Today
- Branch: [name] - [description]
  - Tests: ✅/❌
  - Conflicts resolved: [details]
  - Impact: [description]

## Planned for Tomorrow
- [Branch name] - [reason]

## Blockers
- [Description of any blockers]

## Metrics
- Error rate: [before] → [after]
- Build time: [before] → [after]
- Test coverage: [before] → [after]
```

### 2. Merge Decision Matrix
| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Conflict complexity | 30% | - | - |
| Test coverage | 25% | - | - |
| Business impact | 20% | - | - |
| Dependencies | 15% | - | - |
| Code quality | 10% | - | - |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Map all branches to PR numbers
   - Verify which PRs mentioned in the plan actually exist
   - Run conflict analysis between all branches

2. **Before Starting Merges**:
   - Set up automated testing pipeline
   - Create rollback procedures
   - Establish monitoring dashboards

3. **During Merge Process**:
   - Follow the improved phased approach
   - Use pre-merge validation scripts
   - Document all decisions and changes

4. **Post-Merge**:
   - Monitor metrics for 24 hours after each merge
   - Gather team feedback
   - Update the plan based on learnings

This improved plan provides better safety measures, clearer tracking, and more robust conflict resolution strategies while maintaining the original plan's phased approach.
