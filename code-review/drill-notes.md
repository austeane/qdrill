## Drills Feature Review

This section reviews the code related to browsing, creating, viewing, and editing drills.

**Files Reviewed:**

*   `src/routes/drills/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Good use of SvelteKit features (load, stores, goto). Handles filtering, sorting, pagination.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   `{@html}` used for `brief_description` - requires verification of backend sanitization to prevent XSS.
        *   `buttonStates` logic for cart feedback uses `setTimeout`, which is less declarative/robust than deriving state directly.
        *   Component handles many responsibilities; consider extracting `DrillCard`.
*   `src/routes/drills/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Correctly uses `load` function, parses URL params, uses service layer (`drillService`), fetches data in parallel (`Promise.all`). Good error handling structure.
    *   **Potential Issues:** Ensure filter parsing is robust; consider caching for `filter-options` if appropriate.
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Displays drill details, variations, diagrams, comments. Includes logic for managing variants (modal, search), editing diagrams, adding to cart, deleting.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   `{@html}` used for `detailed_description` - requires backend sanitization verification.
        *   High component complexity; many responsibilities (display, variant management, diagram interaction, API calls).
        *   Local `writable` store (`drill`) duplicates server data; consider using reactive `data` prop directly more often.
        *   Direct `fetch` calls within component; should be abstracted to service/store.
        *   Uses `alert()` instead of `svelte-toast` for cart feedback.
        *   Presence of `console.log` statements.
        *   Variant management modal is a prime candidate for component extraction.
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Simple load function fetching data via internal API (`/api/drills/[id]`). Basic error handling.
    *   **Potential Issues:** Could return more specific HTTP error status codes.
*   `src/routes/drills/create/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Simple wrapper, passes data from load function to `DrillForm`.
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted.
*   `src/routes/drills/create/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Clean load function using service layer to fetch data for the form (skills, drill names). Good error handling.
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted.
*   `src/routes/drills/DrillForm.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Shared component for create/edit. Handles many input types, dynamic lists (diagrams, images), validation, TinyMCE integration, basic auth flow for saving.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Major:** Direct `fetch` calls within the component for submitting the form and adding skills. Needs abstraction (service/store/form action).
        *   High component complexity/size. Should be broken down into smaller, focused components (e.g., `SkillInput`, `DiagramList`, `ImageUpload`).
        *   Imperative child component interaction (`diagramRefs.saveDiagram()`). Event dispatching or binding might be cleaner.
        *   Auth flow uses `sessionStorage`, which can be brittle.
        *   Verbose state management (individual `writable` per field).
        *   Uses browser `confirm()` instead of integrated modals.
        *   Presence of `console.log`.
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/edit/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Clean wrapper component. Uses reactive destructuring. Passes data to `DrillForm`. Basic loading/error display.
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted (relies on `DrillForm` for main functionality/issues).
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/edit/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Excellent load function. Fetches drill, skills, names. Includes crucial server-side authorization check (`canUserEdit`) and good error handling (400, 403, 404, 500).
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles GET (list w/ filters, sort, pagination) and POST (create) for drills. Uses `drillService`. GET parsing is robust. POST passes data and user ID to service.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Major:** Contains non-functional `DELETE` handler (tries to use `params.id`). DELETE logic must be in `[id]/+server.js`.
        *   **Unconventional:** Contains `PUT` handler. While functional (gets ID from body), PUT is typically on the `[id]/+server.js` route.
        *   Minor duplication of filter parsing logic with `drills/+page.server.js`.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Correctly handles GET (one), PUT (update), DELETE for specific drill ID. Uses `drillService`. Includes visibility/auth checks. GET handler enriches data (variant names, parent name). Good error handling structure (constants, helper function).
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Cross-Domain Update:** PUT handler directly updates the `votes` table via `db.query`. This should ideally be handled via a `voteService` or within the `drillService` to maintain separation of concerns.
        *   DELETE handler has a slightly awkward `dev` mode check that bypasses service-level auth; could potentially be handled via configuration/service behavior.
        *   Minor: GET handler fetches user names with direct `db.query`; could be abstracted to `userService` or `drillService`.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/filter-options/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Provides distinct values/ranges for filter fields. Uses parallel SQL queries. Attempts normalization in SQL.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Major:** Creates its own DB client instead of using shared `$lib/server/db.js`. Needs refactoring.
        *   **Major:** Contains complex data fetching logic directly in the API handler. Should be abstracted to `drillService.getFilterOptions()`.
        *   **Performance:** Lacks caching. Filter options are prime candidates for caching (in-memory or external) to reduce DB load.
        *   Data inconsistency suggested by `processResults` function attempting to parse JSON strings from results.
        *   `suggestedLengths` range is hardcoded; might need to be dynamic.

**Files Pending Review:**

*   `src/lib/server/services/drillService.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Extends `BaseEntityService`, enabling standard permissions. Defines drill-specific columns, allowed columns for filtering/sorting, and column types (especially `json` for `diagrams`, `array` for skills, positions, etc.). Overrides `createDrill` and `updateDrill` to handle skill count updates (`updateSkills`, `updateSkillCounts`) within transactions. Overrides `deleteDrill` to enforce stricter deletion permissions (only creator). Implements complex filtering in `getFilteredDrills`, handling array overlaps (`&&`), range queries, boolean checks (using indexed conditions for `hasVideo`, `hasDiagrams`, `hasImages`), text search (`ILIKE`), and visibility rules. Includes methods for managing variations (`getDrillWithVariations`, `createVariation`, `setAsPrimaryVariant` - complex swap logic). Provides `searchDrills` (using base search) and `getDrillNames`. Implements `toggleUpvote` using transactions to manage votes in the `votes` table. Includes `setVariant` for associating/dissociating variations. Contains `normalizeDrillData` helper for data consistency (handling arrays, JSON stringification for diagrams, number fields). Provides `associateDrill` to assign ownership to anonymously created drills. Uses `_addVariationCounts` helper to efficiently add counts to drill lists.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **`getFilteredDrills` Complexity:** This method is very complex, manually building a large SQL query with many conditional filters. This is powerful but prone to errors and hard to maintain. The logic for filtering ranges (`number_of_people`, `suggested_length`) seems particularly complex and might need verification. Using a query builder library could simplify this.
        *   **Filtering Performance:** While some indexed conditions are used (`hasVideo`, etc.), the array overlap (`&&`) and `ILIKE` operators might not be optimally performant on large datasets without specific GIN/GIST indexes on array columns and potentially trigram indexes for text search. Performance testing is recommended. The complexity calculation uses `COUNT(*)`, which can be slow.
        *   **Skill Update Logic:** `updateSkills` uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with a `CASE` statement checking `NOT EXISTS` in a subquery to conditionally increment `drills_used_in`. This is complex SQL logic; ensure it correctly handles all edge cases (e.g., adding/removing skills in the same update).
        *   **`setAsPrimaryVariant` Complexity:** The logic using a temporary negative ID swap is clever but highly unconventional and potentially fragile if IDs could clash or if negative IDs have other meanings. A more standard approach might involve copying data between records.
        *   **Data Normalization:** `normalizeDrillData` explicitly stringifies diagrams (`JSON.stringify`). Ensure this is the desired format for storage and retrieval. It also normalizes array items to lowercase strings, which might be lossy if case sensitivity is ever needed.
        *   **Direct DB Calls:** Still contains direct `db.query` calls for variations (`getDrillWithVariations`), skills (`updateSkills`, `updateSkillCounts`), votes (`toggleUpvote`), and names (`getDrillNames`), bypassing potential base service abstractions.
        *   **Error Handling:** Uses `throw new Error('Message')`, relying on API layers to interpret messages. Custom error types would be more robust.
        *   **`associateDrill`:** Uses `update` from base class, assumes base class correctly handles permissions/updates for this specific case.
*   `src/lib/stores/drillsStore.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Centralizes state for the drills list (data, pagination, loading, filters, sorting). Uses `writable` and `derived`. Includes `initializeDrills` and `resetDrillFilters` helpers. Well-organized.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   Uses separate `writable` stores for each filter category; could consolidate into a single filter object store if complexity grows.
        *   Relies on constants and other stores; ensure dependency management is clear.
        *   `initializeDrills` uses `console.warn` for invalid data.
