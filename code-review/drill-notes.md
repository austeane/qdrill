## Drills Feature Review

This section reviews the code related to browsing, creating, viewing, and editing drills.

**Files Reviewed:**

*   `src/routes/drills/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Good use of SvelteKit features (load, stores, goto). Handles filtering, sorting, pagination.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   `{@html}` used for `brief_description` - requires verification of backend sanitization to prevent XSS.
        *   `buttonStates` logic for cart feedback uses `setTimeout`, which is less declarative/robust than deriving state directly.
        *   Component handles many responsibilities; consider extracting `DrillCard`.
*   `src/routes/drills/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Correctly uses `load` function, parses URL params, uses service layer (`drillService`), fetches data in parallel (`Promise.all`). Good error handling structure.
    *   **Potential Issues:** Ensure filter parsing is robust; consider caching for `filter-options` if appropriate.
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Displays drill details, variations, diagrams, comments. Includes logic for managing variants (modal, search), editing diagrams, adding to cart, deleting.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   `{@html}` used for `detailed_description` - requires backend sanitization verification.
        *   High component complexity; many responsibilities (display, variant management, diagram interaction, API calls).
        *   Local `writable` store (`drill`) duplicates server data; consider using reactive `data` prop directly more often.
        *   Direct `fetch` calls within component; should be abstracted to service/store.
        *   Uses `alert()` instead of `svelte-toast` for cart feedback.
        *   Presence of `console.log` statements.
        *   Variant management modal is a prime candidate for component extraction.
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Simple load function fetching data via internal API (`/api/drills/[id]`). Basic error handling.
    *   **Potential Issues:** Could return more specific HTTP error status codes.
*   `src/routes/drills/create/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Simple wrapper, passes data from load function to `DrillForm`.
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted.
*   `src/routes/drills/create/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Clean load function using service layer to fetch data for the form (skills, drill names). Good error handling.
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted.
*   `src/routes/drills/DrillForm.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Shared component for create/edit. Handles many input types, dynamic lists (diagrams, images), validation, TinyMCE integration, basic auth flow for saving.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Major:** Direct `fetch` calls within the component for submitting the form and adding skills. Needs abstraction (service/store/form action).
        *   High component complexity/size. Should be broken down into smaller, focused components (e.g., `SkillInput`, `DiagramList`, `ImageUpload`).
        *   Imperative child component interaction (`diagramRefs.saveDiagram()`). Event dispatching or binding might be cleaner.
        *   Auth flow uses `sessionStorage`, which can be brittle.
        *   Verbose state management (individual `writable` per field).
        *   Uses browser `confirm()` instead of integrated modals.
        *   Presence of `console.log`.
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/edit/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Clean wrapper component. Uses reactive destructuring. Passes data to `DrillForm`. Basic loading/error display.
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted (relies on `DrillForm` for main functionality/issues).
*   `src/routes/drills/[id]/edit/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Excellent load function. Fetches drill, skills, names. Includes crucial server-side authorization check (`canUserEdit`) and good error handling (400, 403, 404, 500).
    *   **Potential Issues:** None noted.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles GET (list w/ filters, sort, pagination) and POST (create) for drills. Uses `drillService`. GET parsing is robust. POST passes data and user ID to service.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Major:** Contains non-functional `DELETE` handler (tries to use `params.id`). DELETE logic must be in `[id]/+server.js`.
        *   **Unconventional:** Contains `PUT` handler. While functional (gets ID from body), PUT is typically on the `[id]/+server.js` route.
        *   Minor duplication of filter parsing logic with `drills/+page.server.js`.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Correctly handles GET (one), PUT (update), DELETE for specific drill ID. Uses `drillService`. Includes visibility/auth checks. GET handler enriches data (variant names, parent name). Good error handling structure (constants, helper function).
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Cross-Domain Update:** PUT handler directly updates the `votes` table via `db.query`. This should ideally be handled via a `voteService` or within the `drillService` to maintain separation of concerns.
        *   DELETE handler has a slightly awkward `dev` mode check that bypasses service-level auth; could potentially be handled via configuration/service behavior.
        *   Minor: GET handler fetches user names with direct `db.query`; could be abstracted to `userService` or `drillService`.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/filter-options/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Provides distinct values/ranges for filter fields. Uses parallel SQL queries. Attempts normalization in SQL.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Major:** Creates its own DB client instead of using shared `$lib/server/db.js`. Needs refactoring.
        *   **Major:** Contains complex data fetching logic directly in the API handler. Should be abstracted to `drillService.getFilterOptions()`.
        *   **Performance:** Lacks caching. Filter options are prime candidates for caching (in-memory or external) to reduce DB load.
        *   Data inconsistency suggested by `processResults` function attempting to parse JSON strings from results.
        *   `suggestedLengths` range is hardcoded; might need to be dynamic.

**Files Pending Review:**

*   `src/lib/server/services/drillService.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Extends `BaseEntityService`, enabling standard permissions. Defines drill-specific columns, allowed columns for filtering/sorting, and column types (especially `json` for `diagrams`, `array` for skills, positions, etc.). Overrides `createDrill` and `updateDrill` to handle skill count updates (`updateSkills`, `updateSkillCounts`) within transactions. Overrides `deleteDrill` to enforce stricter deletion permissions (only creator). Implements complex filtering in `getFilteredDrills`, handling array overlaps (`&&`), range queries, boolean checks (using indexed conditions for `hasVideo`, `hasDiagrams`, `hasImages`), text search (`ILIKE`), and visibility rules. Includes methods for managing variations (`getDrillWithVariations`, `createVariation`, `setAsPrimaryVariant` - complex swap logic). Provides `searchDrills` (using base search) and `getDrillNames`. Implements `toggleUpvote` using transactions to manage votes in the `votes` table. Includes `setVariant` for associating/dissociating variations. Contains `normalizeDrillData` helper for data consistency (handling arrays, JSON stringification for diagrams, number fields). Provides `associateDrill` to assign ownership to anonymously created drills. Uses `_addVariationCounts` helper to efficiently add counts to drill lists.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **`getFilteredDrills` Complexity:** This method is very complex, manually building a large SQL query with many conditional filters. This is powerful but prone to errors and hard to maintain. The logic for filtering ranges (`number_of_people`, `suggested_length`) seems particularly complex and might need verification. Using a query builder library could simplify this.
        *   **Filtering Performance:** While some indexed conditions are used (`hasVideo`, etc.), the array overlap (`&&`) and `ILIKE` operators might not be optimally performant on large datasets without specific GIN/GIST indexes on array columns and potentially trigram indexes for text search. Performance testing is recommended. The complexity calculation uses `COUNT(*)`, which can be slow.
        *   **Skill Update Logic:** `updateSkills` uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with a `CASE` statement checking `NOT EXISTS` in a subquery to conditionally increment `drills_used_in`. This is complex SQL logic; ensure it correctly handles all edge cases (e.g., adding/removing skills in the same update).
        *   **`setAsPrimaryVariant` Complexity:** The logic using a temporary negative ID swap is clever but highly unconventional and potentially fragile if IDs could clash or if negative IDs have other meanings. A more standard approach might involve copying data between records.
        *   **Data Normalization:** `normalizeDrillData` explicitly stringifies diagrams (`JSON.stringify`). Ensure this is the desired format for storage and retrieval. It also normalizes array items to lowercase strings, which might be lossy if case sensitivity is ever needed.
        *   **Direct DB Calls:** Still contains direct `db.query` calls for variations (`getDrillWithVariations`), skills (`updateSkills`, `updateSkillCounts`), votes (`toggleUpvote`), and names (`getDrillNames`), bypassing potential base service abstractions.
        *   **Error Handling:** Uses `throw new Error('Message')`, relying on API layers to interpret messages. Custom error types would be more robust.
        *   **`associateDrill`:** Uses `update` from base class, assumes base class correctly handles permissions/updates for this specific case.
*   `src/lib/stores/drillsStore.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Centralizes state for the drills list (data, pagination, loading, filters, sorting). Uses `writable` and `derived`. Includes `initializeDrills` and `resetDrillFilters` helpers. Well-organized.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   Uses separate `writable` stores for each filter category; could consolidate into a single filter object store if complexity grows.
        *   Relies on constants and other stores; ensure dependency management is clear.
        *   `initializeDrills` uses `console.warn` for invalid data.

## Drill API Routes Review

*   `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/variations/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles GET (list variations including parent/siblings) and POST (create variation). Uses `drillService` (`getById`, `getDrillWithVariations`, `createVariation`). GET logic intelligently fetches context (parent, siblings) depending on whether the requested `[id]` is a parent or a child. POST requires logged-in user and validates `name`. Includes a shared error helper.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **GET Complexity:** The logic in GET to handle both parent/child cases and reorder results is complex and could be hard to follow or debug.
        *   **Error Handling:** Relies on specific error message strings caught from the service (e.g., 'Parent drill not found'). Using custom error classes propagated from the service would be more robust.
        *   **Authorization (GET):** The GET handler doesn't perform explicit authorization checks itself; it relies on the underlying `drillService` methods (`getById`, `getDrillWithVariations`) to enforce visibility rules based on the user (or lack thereof). This implicit reliance should be verified. POST correctly requires a session user ID.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/associate/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles POST requests to assign ownership (`user_id`) of a presumably anonymously created drill (`[id]`) to the currently authenticated user. Correctly checks for an active session and user ID (returns 401 otherwise). Uses `drillService.associateDrill`. Handles specific error cases gracefully (invalid ID 400, not found 404, already owned 200 - idempotent).
    *   **Potential Issues:** Seems straightforward and uses the service layer appropriately. Authorization is correctly implemented.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/set-variant/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles PUT requests to establish or remove the parent-child relationship between drills (setting `parent_drill_id` on the drill `[id]`). Takes `parentDrillId` (can be null) from the request body. Uses `drillService.setVariant` to encapsulate the complex logic. Validates the incoming `drillId`. Catches specific error messages from the service (e.g., 'Drill not found', 'Cannot make a parent drill into a variant') and maps them to appropriate HTTP status codes (404, 400).
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Authorization:** No explicit authorization check within the handler. Relies entirely on `drillService.setVariant` to ensure the user making the request has permission to modify the drill relationships (e.g., is the owner). This delegation is acceptable but needs to be verified in the service implementation.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/upvote/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles POST requests for a logged-in user to toggle their upvote status on a specific drill `[id]`. Checks for session and user ID (returns 401 if none). Validates `drillId`. Uses `drillService.toggleUpvote`, which presumably handles the transactional logic of updating both the drill's `upvotes` count and the `votes` table. Returns the updated `upvotes` count and the user's current voting status (`hasVoted`). Uses SvelteKit's `error` helper for 400 (Invalid ID) and 404 (Not Found) errors based on service feedback.
    *   **Potential Issues:** Clear implementation relying on the service layer. Authorization check is present.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/search/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles GET requests to search for drills by name or retrieve a list of drill names (if the `query` parameter is empty). Parses URL parameters for `query`, `page`, `limit`, and `includePagination`. Uses `drillService.searchDrills` (returning only `id`, `name`) when a query exists and `drillService.getDrillNames` otherwise. Optionally includes pagination metadata in the response.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Mixed Responsibilities:** The endpoint serves two slightly different purposes (search vs. get-all-names) based on the presence of the `query` param. While functional, dedicated endpoints might offer better clarity.
        *   **Arbitrary Limit:** When no query is provided, it defaults to fetching names via `drillService.getDrillNames` but then slices the result to 50 unless a `limit` is specified. This fallback limit seems arbitrary and potentially inconsistent with `getDrillNames` internal logic.
        *   **Authorization:** No explicit authorization checks. Relies on the underlying service methods (`searchDrills`, `getDrillNames`) to handle visibility filtering based on user context (if any).
*   `src/routes/api/drills/names/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles GET requests specifically to retrieve a list of drill IDs and names, intended for populating dropdowns or similar UI elements. Retrieves the user ID from the session and passes it to `drillService.getFilteredDrills` to ensure only visible drills are returned. Configures the service call to sort by name and select only `id` and `name`.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Hardcoded Limit:** Uses a hardcoded `limit: 1000` in the service call. This is problematic for scalability; if the number of drills exceeds 1000, the list will be incomplete. This endpoint should implement proper pagination or be used only in contexts where fetching *all* names is truly necessary and feasible.
        *   **Overlap with `/search`:** Functionality significantly overlaps with `search/+server.js` when its `query` parameter is empty. The primary difference is this endpoint explicitly passes the `userId` for filtering, whereas `/search` relies implicitly on the service. Consider consolidating or better differentiating the use cases.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/associate/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** This route appears identical in function to `src/routes/api/drills/[id]/associate/+server.js`. It handles POST requests to assign ownership of an anonymous drill to the authenticated user. However, it expects the `drillId` in the *request body* instead of the URL parameters.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Redundancy:** Functionally duplicates the `[id]/associate` route. One should likely be removed to avoid confusion. Using the ID in the URL (`[id]/associate`) is more conventional REST practice for acting on a specific resource.
        *   **Authorization:** Correctly uses `authGuard` to ensure user is logged in.
        *   **Error Handling:** Handles not found and already owned errors.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/bulk-upload/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles POST requests containing a CSV file (`multipart/form-data`) for parsing and *validating* drill data. Uses `csv-parse` for parsing and `Yup` for validation against a detailed `drillSchema`. Maps numeric codes from the CSV (skill level, complexity) to string representations. Filters skills/positions/types against predefined lists. Adds user ID, visibility, and `is_editable_by_others` flags. Returns a summary (total, valid, errors) and the full list of parsed/validated drill objects, including row numbers and error messages for invalid ones.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Validation Only:** This endpoint *only validates* the CSV data; it does **not** actually insert the drills into the database. A separate step or endpoint (like `import/+server.js`) would be needed to persist the validated drills. This is a critical distinction.
        *   **Hardcoded Mappings:** Uses hardcoded maps (`skillLevelMap`, `complexityMap`, `drillTypeOptions`). Changes to these require code modification.
        *   **Validation Library:** Uses `Yup` for validation, which is a valid choice but introduces another dependency. SvelteKit's built-in form actions and validation could potentially be used, though `Yup` offers powerful schema definition.
        *   **Error Reporting:** Returns validation errors associated with each drill object. The frontend needs to handle displaying these clearly.
        *   **Authorization:** Correctly uses `authGuard`.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/import/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Handles POST requests with a JSON payload containing an array of `drills` to be inserted into the database. Assigns the authenticated user's ID as `created_by`, uses a provided `visibility`, and sets `is_editable_by_others` to `false`. Generates a unique `upload_source` identifier using the provided `fileName` and a UUID. Performs the insertions within a database transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK). Handles diagram data (ensuring it's an array, stringifying each object). Uses `authGuard`.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **New DB Client:** Creates its own `pg.Pool` instead of using the shared `$lib/server/db.js` module. This bypasses the shared pool configuration and connection management, which is highly undesirable. Should be refactored to use `db.query` or `db.getClient`.
        *   **Data Validation:** Assumes the incoming `drills` array in the JSON payload has already been validated (e.g., by the `bulk-upload` endpoint). It performs minimal checks (is array, not empty) but directly attempts insertion. Errors during insertion (e.g., constraint violations) will cause the transaction to roll back.
        *   **Diagram Stringification:** Explicitly stringifies each diagram object before insertion. This matches the expectation noted in `drillService` review but reinforces the potential issues with storing stringified JSON.
        *   **Hardcoded Defaults:** Sets `is_editable_by_others` to `false`. Might need flexibility.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/migrate-diagrams/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** One-off utility endpoint (POST) to migrate existing Fabric.js diagrams stored in the `drills` table to the Excalidraw format using the `fabricToExcalidraw` utility. Fetches all drills with non-empty diagrams, iterates through them, converts diagrams (skipping nulls and already converted ones), and updates the `diagrams` column in the database with the stringified result. Runs all updates in parallel (`Promise.all`).
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **New DB Client:** Creates its own `pg` client instance instead of using the shared `$lib/server/db.js`. Should be refactored.
        *   **One-Time Use:** This is clearly intended for a single data migration. Should be documented as such, secured (e.g., admin-only or environment-variable protected, currently unprotected), and potentially removed after the migration is successfully completed.
        *   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling; if one update fails, `Promise.all` rejects, but it doesn't report *which* drill failed.
        *   **Scalability:** Fetches *all* drills with diagrams at once. Could be memory-intensive for very large datasets. Batching might be necessary.
*   `src/routes/api/drills/test-migration/+server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Development-only (checks `dev` environment variable) POST endpoint for testing the `fabricToExcalidraw` conversion utility. Takes a single `diagram` object in the request body and returns the converted Excalidraw object as JSON.
    *   **Potential Issues:** Useful utility for development/debugging the migration function. Protected by `dev` flag, which is appropriate. Should not be enabled in production.

## Drill Page Components Review

*   `src/routes/drills/bulk-upload/+page.server.js` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Simple `load` function that fetches all drills (`/api/drills?all=true`). Includes basic error handling.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **Unused Data?** Fetches *all* existing drills. It's unclear if/how this data is actually used by the `+page.svelte` component. The component seems focused on *new* drills from the CSV, not existing ones. This fetch might be unnecessary and potentially slow.
        *   **API Endpoint:** Relies on the `/api/drills` GET endpoint having an `?all=true` parameter to bypass pagination. Ensure this API behavior is intended and efficient.
        *   **Error Handling:** Returns a generic `{ status: 500, error: 'Internal Server Error' }` which isn't ideal for the page; SvelteKit's `error()` helper might be better for displaying a proper error page.

*   `src/routes/drills/bulk-upload/+page.svelte` ✅
    *   **Notes:** Complex component facilitating a multi-stage CSV upload process: 1) Upload CSV, 2) Set visibility, 3) Call `/api/drills/bulk-upload` to parse/validate, 4) Display parsed drills (filtered by validity), 5) Allow inline editing/validation of parsed drills, 6) Allow adding/editing diagrams (`ExcalidrawWrapper`), 7) Call `/api/drills/import` to save valid drills to DB. Uses local `writable` stores for state management (`uploadedFile`, `isUploading`, `uploadSummary`, `parsedDrills`, `filterOption`, `visibility`). Includes client-side validation (`validateDrill`) that largely duplicates the Yup schema logic from the API route. Provides a CSV template download.
    *   **Potential Issues:**
        *   **High Complexity:** Manages a complex workflow with significant state, UI logic, validation, and multiple API interactions. Prone to bugs and difficult to maintain.
        *   **Duplicate Validation:** Client-side `validateDrill` function re-implements validation logic already present (using Yup) in the `/api/drills/bulk-upload` endpoint. This duplication is error-prone. The component should rely *solely* on the API's validation results returned in the `parsedDrills.errors` array.
        *   **State Management:** Uses many individual `writable` stores. Could potentially be grouped into a single store or use SvelteKit form actions for better state handling, especially for the editing state.
        *   **Inline Editing:** Allows editing parsed data *after* server-side validation. Saving an edited drill re-runs the client-side validation. This flow is confusing; ideally, edits would be saved and immediately re-validated via an API call, or edits would be disallowed after the initial validation.
        *   **Diagram Handling:** Integrates `ExcalidrawWrapper` for adding/editing diagrams *before* the drills are imported. This adds complexity; perhaps diagrams should only be editable *after* successful import via the standard drill edit page.
        *   **Unused `saveChanges`:** The `saveChanges` function seems redundant as edits are applied directly to the local `parsedDrills` store.
        *   **UI/UX:** The process of upload -> review -> edit -> import could potentially be streamlined. Error display relies on checking specific error strings.
        *   **Performance:** Handling/rendering/validating a large number of parsed drills entirely on the client-side could become slow.
