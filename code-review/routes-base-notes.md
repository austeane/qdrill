# Base Routes Code Review Notes

This file contains notes on the review of the base `src/routes/` directory and its immediate, smaller subdirectories like `about`, `admin`, `auth`, `privacy-policy`, `profile`, and `terms-of-service`.

## `src/routes/+layout.server.js`

- **Notes:** This root `load` function runs for every page. It retrieves the current session using `locals.getSession()` and returns it. This makes the user's session data (including user ID if logged in) available to all pages via `data.session`.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. This is standard practice in SvelteKit for making session data globally available.

## `src/routes/+layout.svelte`

- **Notes:** This is the root layout component wrapping all pages. It imports the global stylesheet (`app.css`). It uses a `{#key $page.url.pathname}` block around the `<slot />`. This ensures that components are re-rendered when the pathname changes, which can be important for triggering lifecycle functions or resetting component state on navigation. It includes the `Header.svelte` component. It also sets up `svelte-toast` for notifications.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **`{#key $page.url.pathname}`:** While often useful, forcing a full re-render on every path change might sometimes be unnecessary or even detrimental to perceived performance or component state preservation if not carefully managed. Evaluate if this behavior is always desirable or if specific components could handle state updates more granularly. However, it's a common pattern for ensuring components depending on the URL behave predictably.
  - **CSS Import:** Imports `app.css`. Standard practice.

## `src/routes/+page.js`

- **Notes:** This client-side `load` function appears to fetch data for the homepage poll feature. It makes two API calls: `/api/poll` to get poll questions and `/api/poll/options` to get poll options. It then seems to combine these results.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **Poll Feature Location:** This loads poll data for the root page (`/`). Is the poll displayed directly on the homepage? If not, this data loading might be misplaced. It seems more related to the `/poll` route.
  - **Error Handling:** Basic `try...catch` logs errors but returns an empty object (`{}`) on failure. This might cause downstream issues in the component expecting `pollQuestions` or `pollOptions`. It should return a more informative error state or default values if appropriate.
  - **API Dependency:** Relies on `/api/poll` and `/api/poll/options` endpoints.

## `src/routes/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** This is the application's homepage. It displays static marketing/introduction content (hero image, feature descriptions). It also renders the `Poll` component using data loaded from `+page.js` (`data.pollQuestions`, `data.pollOptions`). Includes a call to action linking to `/practice-plans`.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **Poll Component Data:** Relies on the data structure returned by `+page.js`. If that load function fails and returns `{}`, the `Poll` component might error or render incorrectly. Needs defensive checks (e.g., `{#if data.pollQuestions}`).
  - **Static Content:** Mostly static content, seems fine.
  - **Poll Integration:** The integration of the poll feature directly on the homepage seems specific. Ensure this is the intended location and UX.

## `src/routes/Counter.svelte`

- **Notes:** A very simple component demonstrating a reactive counter using Svelte's script and template syntax. Increments a count on button click.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **Purpose/Usage:** This looks like **example code** possibly left over from the SvelteKit skeleton project or early development. It doesn't appear to be used anywhere in the main application flow based on the file structure. Likely safe to **remove**.

## `src/routes/Header.svelte`

- **Notes:** The main site navigation header. Uses `$page.data.session` to conditionally display user-specific links (Profile, Admin, Logout) or a Login button. Includes links to major sections (Drills, Formations, Practice Plans, About). Uses the `LoginButton` component. Includes the application logo. Uses TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **Admin Link Visibility:** The Admin link is shown if `data.session?.user?.role === 'admin'`. Ensure the `role` property is correctly populated in the session data by the Auth.js configuration (`src/lib/server/auth.js` session callback) and that role management is secure.
  - **Mobile Responsiveness:** Needs verification on how the header adapts to smaller screen sizes (e.g., hamburger menu). The code uses Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`), suggesting responsiveness is intended.

## `src/routes/about/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** Simple static content page providing information about the application. Uses standard HTML tags within a Svelte component structure.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. Standard static page.

## `src/routes/admin/+layout.server.js`

- **Notes:** This `load` function acts as a guard for the `/admin` section. It checks if the user exists in the session (`!locals.user`) and if their role is 'admin' (`locals.user.role !== 'admin'`). If either check fails, it throws a 403 Forbidden error using SvelteKit's `error` helper.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. Correctly implements role-based access control for the admin section using a layout server load function, which is the recommended SvelteKit approach.

## `src/routes/admin/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** The main page for the admin section. Displays a welcome message (`Welcome, Admin!`) and mentions potential future admin functionalities (User Management, Content Moderation, System Settings).
- **Potential Issues:** Currently just a placeholder. Functionality would need to be added.

## `src/routes/auth/[...auth]/+server.js`

- **Notes:** Re-exports the `handlers` (GET and POST) from the main Auth.js configuration (`$lib/server/auth.js`). This is the standard way to integrate Auth.js handlers into SvelteKit routes.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. Correctly delegates authentication handling to the centralized configuration.

## `src/routes/auth/error/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** Displays authentication-related error messages. It retrieves potential error codes/messages from the URL query parameters (`$page.url.searchParams.get('error')`). It maps known Auth.js error codes (like 'Configuration', 'AccessDenied', 'Verification') to user-friendly messages. Includes a link to sign in again.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **Error Mapping:** The error messages are hardcoded. While covering common Auth.js errors, it might not handle all possible custom error scenarios or provide detailed context.
  - **UX:** Provides basic error feedback. Depending on the error, more specific guidance could potentially be offered.

## `src/routes/privacy-policy/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** Simple static content page displaying the privacy policy. Uses standard HTML markup within a Svelte component.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. Standard static page.

## `src/routes/profile/+page.server.js`

- **Notes:** Server `load` function for the user profile page. It includes an authentication guard: if `locals.user` is not present, it throws a 401 Unauthorized error. If the user is logged in, it returns the `user` object from the session.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. Correctly ensures only authenticated users can access this page and provides the necessary user data.

## `src/routes/profile/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** Displays the logged-in user's profile information obtained from the `load` function (`data.user`). Shows the user's name, email, and image (avatar). Includes a `Logout` button implemented via a form POST request to `/auth/signout`. Provides links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - **Logout Method:** Uses a standard HTML form POST for logout, which is the recommended method by Auth.js for CSRF protection. This is correct.
  - **Data Display:** Displays basic profile information. If more user details were stored (e.g., preferences, bio), they could be added here.

## `src/routes/terms-of-service/+page.svelte`

- **Notes:** Simple static content page displaying the terms of service. Uses standard HTML markup within a Svelte component.
- **Potential Issues:** None apparent. Standard static page.

**Summary & Recommendations:**

- The base routing structure, layouts, and authentication guards (`admin`, `profile`) seem correctly implemented using standard SvelteKit patterns.
- The homepage (`+page.svelte`, `+page.js`) loads and displays poll data, which might be better located within the `/poll` route unless specifically intended for the homepage. Error handling in `+page.js` could be improved.
- The `Counter.svelte` component appears to be unused example code and should likely be removed.
- Static pages (`about`, `privacy-policy`, `terms-of-service`) are straightforward.
- The `auth/error` page provides basic feedback but could potentially be enhanced.
- Admin page is currently a placeholder.
- Consider reviewing the mobile responsiveness of the `Header.svelte`.
- Ensure the 'admin' role is securely managed and correctly populated in the session.
