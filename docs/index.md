## Overview

This documentation provides detailed information about the QDrill project, covering its architecture, implementation details, and development guidelines.

A comprehensive code review was recently conducted to assess the codebase and identify areas for improvement. The findings and recommendations are documented in the `code-review/` directory at the root of the project. See [`code-review/holistic-summary.md`](../code-review/holistic-summary.md) for a high-level overview.

## Documentation Workflow

When making changes to the codebase:

1. First examine this index file to understand the documentation structure
2. Navigate to the appropriate subdirectory based on the nature of your changes:
   - `/docs/architecture/` for architectural changes or patterns
   - `/docs/implementation/` for implementation details and technical references
3. Update existing documentation files or create new ones as needed
4. Update index files to reference any new documentation

## Documentation Requirements

- Create/update documentation when modifying .js/.svelte files
- Document component descriptions, usage instructions, and relationships
- Maintain documentation consistency for directory structure
- Consider component interdependencies when making changes
- Follow best practices for Svelte documentation
