# FilterPanel Component Errors

## Issue Description
During testing of PR #127 (SQL duplication refactoring), JavaScript TypeErrors were discovered in the FilterPanel component. These errors are unrelated to the SQL refactoring but should be addressed.

## Error Details

### Error 1: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
**Location**: `src/lib/components/FilterPanel.svelte:1359:65`
**Stack Trace**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at http://localhost:3000/src/lib/components/FilterPanel.svelte:1359:65
    at update_reaction
    at update_effect
    at process_effects
    at flush_queued_root_effects
```

### Error 2: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
**Location**: `src/lib/components/FilterPanel.svelte:724:23`
**Stack Trace**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at http://localhost:3000/src/lib/components/FilterPanel.svelte:724:23
    at update_reaction

    at flushSync

    at async navigate
```

## When Errors Occur
The errors appear when:
1. Opening the "Skills Focused On" filter dropdown
2. Selecting a skill filter (e.g., "defense")
3. During filter state changes

## Impact
- The errors appear in the console but don't seem to break functionality
- Filter selection and drill filtering still work despite the errors
- This suggests defensive coding issues where undefined checks are missing

## Potential Root Causes
1. A reactive statement or computed value is trying to access the `.length` property on an undefined variable
2. Likely related to filter state management or skill list processing
3. May be a race condition where data is accessed before it's initialized

## Recommended Fix Approach
1. Add null/undefined checks before accessing `.length` properties in FilterPanel.svelte
2. Review lines 724 and 1359 in FilterPanel.svelte
3. Check all reactive statements that process arrays or collections
4. Consider adding default values for filter-related state variables

## Testing Notes
- Discovered on branch: `tme4ul-codex/update-ticket-23-refactor-sql-duplication`
- Test date: 2025-07-19
- Browser console shows errors but functionality continues to work
- Errors are reproducible by interacting with skill filters

## Priority
Medium - While not breaking functionality, these errors clutter the console and indicate potential future issues if the code path changes.
