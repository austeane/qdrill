# PR #117 - Add to Plan Unauthenticated Review

## Overview
PR #117 is a documentation-only PR that updates the ticket for the "Add to Plan" button functionality for unauthenticated users. The ticket has been marked as **Resolved** because the feature already works correctly.

## Current Behavior
The "Add to Plan" button already works for both authenticated and unauthenticated users:
- Drills are stored in `localStorage` via `cartStore.js`
- No authentication is required to build practice plans
- Plans created without a user ID are automatically set to `public`
- The cart persists across page reloads

## What This PR Does
- Updates the ticket status from "Open" to "Resolved"
- Clarifies that the current implementation already handles unauthenticated users
- Documents that no code changes are required
- Provides optional enhancement suggestions for future consideration

## Optional Future Enhancements
The ticket suggests several optional improvements that could be implemented later:

1. **Tooltip Encouragement**: Add a tooltip to encourage sign-in for private plan features
2. **Modal Sign-In Prompt**: Show a modal when unauthenticated users try to add drills
3. **Enhanced Button State**: Different button text/styling for unauthenticated users

## Recommendation
**Merge this PR** as it correctly documents that the feature is already working as intended. The current implementation is user-friendly by allowing unauthenticated users to build practice plans, which is good for conversion and user experience.

The optional enhancements suggested in the ticket could be considered for future iterations if user testing shows a need for clearer communication about the benefits of signing in.

## Testing Status
The existing functionality has been verified to work:
- ✅ Unauthenticated users can add drills to cart
- ✅ Cart persists in localStorage
- ✅ Users can create practice plans without signing in
- ✅ Plans default to public when created anonymously
