# Teams Feature - Remaining Work

## Testing Summary (August 27, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Working Features
1. **Authentication**: Google OAuth successfully fixed and working
2. **Teams List Page**: Displays teams with proper role badges
3. **Season Management**:
   - Overview view displays season information
   - Schedule view shows week/month calendar with navigation
   - Manage view shows sections and events with CRUD actions
4. **UI Components**: Successfully migrated to custom UI components
5. **Data Display**: All season data properly loaded and displayed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working Features
1. **Create Practice Dialog**: 
   - Opens successfully with proper form fields
   - Pre-fills date and time correctly
   - Shows practice type dropdown
   - But "Create Practice" button doesn't submit (no backend implementation)

2. **Create Team Button**: 
   - Button exists but dialog doesn't open when clicked
   - Likely missing dialog implementation

### üî¥ Known Issues and Remaining Work

#### High Priority
1. **Complete Practice Creation Flow**
   - Implement backend API endpoint for creating practices
   - Connect form submission to API
   - Add practice to calendar view after creation
   - Implement "Create and edit immediately" functionality

2. **Fix Create Team Dialog**
   - Implement/fix the Create Team dialog component
   - Connect to backend API for team creation
   - Add proper form validation

3. **Complete Event/Marker Creation**
   - Test and fix "Add Event" button functionality
   - Implement event creation dialog if missing
   - Connect to backend API

#### Medium Priority
4. **Section Management**
   - Test "Add Section" functionality
   - Verify edit/delete operations work
   - Test move up/down functionality

5. **Practice Plan Integration**
   - Link practices to existing practice plans
   - Allow selection of practice plans when creating practices
   - Display practice plan details in schedule view

6. **Recurrences Page**
   - Test recurring practice functionality
   - Ensure proper date handling for recurring events

#### Low Priority
7. **UI Polish**
   - Fix self-closing HTML tag warnings in Svelte components
   - Fix unused CSS selector warnings
   - Fix accessibility warnings (form labels, ARIA roles)
   - Clean up unused export properties

8. **Week View Page**
   - Test navigation between weeks
   - Verify month view toggle works
   - Test practice/event display on calendar

## Technical Debt
1. **Environment Variables**: Successfully fixed - now using SvelteKit's `$env/dynamic/private`
2. **Component Warnings**: Multiple Svelte warnings need addressing
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper error messages for failed operations

## Next Steps
1. Implement backend endpoints for practice/event creation
2. Fix Create Team dialog functionality
3. Complete practice creation flow end-to-end
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Address all Svelte component warnings

## Files Requiring Attention
- `/src/lib/components/season/desktop/CreatePracticeDialog.svelte` - Submit functionality
- `/src/routes/teams/+page.svelte` - Create Team dialog
- `/src/lib/components/season/views/Schedule.svelte` - Practice display after creation
- `/src/routes/api/teams/[teamId]/practices/+server.js` - API endpoint needed
- Various component files with HTML/CSS warnings
