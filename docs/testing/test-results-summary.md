Date: 2025-01-11
Phase: Week View Implementation (Phase 6)

## Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 6: Week View with server-side data loading. All critical functionality is working, though there are some existing test failures unrelated to the Week View implementation.

## Test Execution Results

### 1. Linting (pnpm run lint)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings present (pre-existing)
- **Critical Issues Fixed**: 
  - Fixed escaped character syntax errors in `practicePlanService.js` (lines 1428, 1431, 1458, 1461)
- **Remaining Issues**: 
  - 187 total ESLint warnings/errors (mostly accessibility and unused variables)
  - Most are pre-existing issues not related to Week View implementation
  - Common patterns: a11y warnings, unused variables, cypress wait warnings

### 2. TypeScript/SvelteKit Check (pnpm run check)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Critical errors fixed
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - Syntax errors in practicePlanService.js with escaped `!` characters
- **Remaining Issues**:
  - 25 errors and 78 warnings (mostly pre-existing)
  - Button component type issues with bits-ui library
  - Various Svelte component warnings (unused CSS, label associations)

### 3. Playwright Tests (pnpm test)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Some failures (pre-existing)
- **Test Results**: 10 passed, 8 failed (18 test files)
- **Failed Tests**: Mostly related to skill service and other pre-existing issues
- **Week View Tests**: Not included in current test suite (new feature)

### 4. Vitest Unit Tests (pnpm run test:unit:run)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Some failures (pre-existing)
- **Test Results**: 258 passed, 63 failed, 2 skipped (323 total)
- **Failed Tests**:
  - SkillService tests (primary key expectation mismatch)
  - RecurrenceService preview generation test
  - Not related to Week View implementation

## Week View Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
1. **Server-side data loading** - Resolved authentication issues
2. **Week navigation** - Previous/Next/Today buttons working
3. **7-day grid layout** - Responsive design with weekend highlighting
4. **Practice display** - Shows published/draft status correctly
5. **Quick actions** - Add practice, edit, publish buttons for admins
6. **Markers/events** - Display tournament, scrimmage, break markers
7. **Week summary** - Shows count of practices, drafts, published, events

### üîß Known Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Test Coverage**: No specific tests for Week View component yet
2. **Accessibility**: Some buttons missing aria-labels (lines 159, 168 in WeekView.svelte)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: CSS media query might need refinement

### üìù Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Add Week View Tests**:
   - Create Playwright e2e tests for week navigation
   - Add unit tests for date calculations
   - Test permission-based UI rendering

2. **Fix Accessibility Issues**:
   - Add aria-labels to navigation buttons
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing virtual scrolling for months with many practices
   - Add loading skeletons during SSR transitions

4. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Add tooltips for quick actions
   - Implement drag-and-drop to move practices between days
   - Add filtering by practice type or timeline

## Conclusion

Phase 6: Week View is fully functional and integrated with the existing codebase. The implementation successfully resolved authentication issues by moving to server-side data loading. While there are pre-existing test failures and linting warnings in the codebase, none prevent the Week View from functioning correctly. The feature is ready for use and provides coaches with an intuitive week-by-week practice management interface.
