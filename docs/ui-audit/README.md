## üõ† Required Dependencies

Install these before starting implementation:

```bash
pnpm add @radix-ui/colors mode-watcher sveltekit-superforms
```

Already installed dependencies that will be used:
- `bits-ui` - Headless UI components
- `cmdk-sv` - Command palette
- `lucide-svelte` - Icons
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `@zerodevx/svelte-toast` - Toast notifications

## üìã Each Ticket Contains

- **Overview** - What the ticket accomplishes
- **Prerequisites** - Dependencies and prior tickets needed
- **File Structure** - New and modified files
- **Implementation Steps** - Complete code examples
- **Testing Checklist** - Verification points
- **Integration Notes** - How it connects with other components

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Read the foundation tickets** (001-003) to understand the design system
2. **Install required dependencies** listed above
3. **Start with Ticket 001** to establish the design token system
4. **Follow the implementation order** or work on independent tickets in parallel
5. **Use the testing checklists** to verify each implementation

## üìä Scope & Impact

- **Total Files**: ~50+ components and utilities
- **Lines of Code**: ~5,000+ new/modified lines
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation
- **Testing Required**: Unit, integration, accessibility, and visual regression tests

## üé® Design Principles

1. **Token-Driven Design** - All colors, spacing, and typography use CSS variables
2. **Accessibility First** - WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
3. **Performance Optimized** - Lazy loading, content visibility, virtual scrolling
4. **Mobile Responsive** - All components work on mobile devices
5. **Developer Experience** - Clear code structure, comprehensive logging, TypeScript support

## üìù Notes

- Each ticket is self-contained with all necessary code
- Reference implementations are complete and copy-paste ready
- Components are reusable across the application
- Follow existing code conventions in the codebase
