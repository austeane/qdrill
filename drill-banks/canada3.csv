Stationary tackle,Learn basics of how to tackle,"Players pair off and form two lines, with each player facing their partner. The coach will instruct one line to get into position to tackle their opponent, and check each player's positioning before asking the other line to move towards the tacklers slowly. Tacklers will then practice where to position their body with respect to the tacklee. Once the coach is satisfied that all players have a basic understanding and will not injure themselves or others, players may move apart and practice at their own pace.","Skill-focus,Contact",2,2,5,15,2,,"Tackling, Body Positioning, Safety","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Angle of pursuit,Learn how to intercept an opponent; Practice tackles,"All players line up, spread out, on the starting line at one end of the pitch (or at starting cone). On the coach's call, the player on the end (the quaffle carrier) begins running straight down the pitch; they must continue in this straight line and not swerve. All other players must run at an angle to permit a legal tackle, and attempt to bring the quaffle carrier to the ground. If the quaffle carrier reaches the other set of hoops, they 'win' and you may assign a small punishment (i.e. a lap, 5 pushups, etc) to the rest of the players.","Skill-focus,Contact",3,3,10,20,4,,"Tackling, Angles of Pursuit, Teamwork","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Quick recovery,Learn to stay on broom while rolling,"While mounted on a broom, players performs practice rolls (forwards, sideways, and backwards) while trying to get back on your feet as quickly as possible. Coaches can also call a direction to roll if doing this with a whole team.","Skill-focus,Conditioning",1,1,5,10,1,,"Agility, Broom Control, Recovery, Balance","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Death pit/Run ALL the places,Field awareness,"Cones are set up to mark off an area in which players may be - usually a circle. Chasers are given 1-2 quaffles; there are 2-3 beaters with balls (depending on how many quaffle players you have). Once a chaser is hit, they are out. They may dodge or quaffle block, and are encouraged to communicate with other quaffle players to call attention to where the beaters are, as well as pass the quaffle to people about to be beat so they may quaffle block.","Skill-focus,Competitive",3,3,10,15,5,,"Field Awareness, Quaffle Blocking, Dodging, Communication","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
3-man weave 2.0,Whatever you need it to be,"The 3-man weave can be modified to train just about any basic skill. Through the addition of a keeper, defensive chaser or defensive chasers, defensive beater, offensive beater, etc., you can create game-like scenarios that run slowly and one at a time to train situations, plays, and communication.","Skill-focus,Tactic-focus,Match-like situation",2,2,10,20,3,,"Passing, Communication, Situational Awareness","Chaser,Beater,Keeper",,
3-man weave 2.1,Recovery of bludger control; communication between beaters and chasers,"Set up for 3-man weave, but add a line of beaters on one side of the chasers, and a keeper and 2 beaters on defense. There are 4 options from this setup: 2 defensive beaters each with balls, and offensive beater without a ball; 2 defensive beaters each with balls, and offensive beater with a ball; 2 defensive beaters with 1 ball and offensive beater with a ball; 2 defensive beaters with 1 ball and offensive beater without a ball. Each of these scenarios is slightly different and will force both the beater and chasers to react differently. Roate chasers and beaters through the defensive positions.","Skill-focus,Tactic-focus,Match-like situation",3,2,10,20,6,,"Bludger Control, Communication, Passing, Decision Making","Chaser,Beater,Keeper",,
3-man weave 2.2,Chaser defense,"Set up for 3-man weave, but add a single defensive chaser and a keeper who must intercept the ball. Rotate chasers through this defensive position (especially chasers who have weaker agility or defensive positioning).","Skill-focus,Tactic-focus,Match-like situation",4,2,10,20,5,,"Chaser Defense, Interceptions, Passing Under Pressure","Chaser,Keeper",,
3-man weave 2.3,Play creation,"Set up for 3-man weave with any defensive setup desired (recommended: start with none, then add in a keeper, chaser, and beater, in that order). Put chasers together in groups of 3 - if you have set lines, put your lines together. Each line will run a weave until midfield, and after that they're free to try any play they would like. This will encourage players to take initiative and put together the base skills they have into movement patterns, and you're likely to notice things that actually start to work.","Skill-focus,Tactic-focus,Match-like situation",4,3,15,30,6,,"Playmaking, Communication, Creativity","Chaser,Beater,Keeper",,
Ball retrieval,Improve ability to pick up ground balls; direction changes,"The players line up in one line beside the coach. The coach throws or kicks a ball corresponding to the position of the player and the player must sprint to retrieve it, pick it up, then sprint back and drop it at the feet of the coach. A variation on this is to kick or throw one ball and two players sprint to retrieve it, simulating a situation in which two players are fighting for a ball.","Skill-focus,Conditioning",2,1,5,15,2,,"Ground Ball Retrieval, Agility, Speed, Direction Changes","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Circle of death,Bludger avoidance; quaffle blocking; field awareness; beater aim; controlling rebounds,"Cones are set up to make a circle. The size of the circle will depend on how many chasers you have at practice. The chasers should have enough space to run comfortably but also be forced to think quickly and make quick direction changes. Chasers are in the middle of the circle, and beaters are all around the outside. Chasers can be given quaffles with which they may block, and the beaters can be given enough bludgers that there will always be one or two beaters without a ball - it is their responsibility to go for the rebounds of the other beaters. The drill can be timed and run several times: after the first baseline time, if the time is longer, chasers win; if the time is shorter, the beaters win. Alternately, give the beaters a time limit in which to knock out all the chasers; if there are chasers remaining after the time limit, the chasers win.","Skill-focus,Competitive",5,2,10,20,6,,"Bludger Avoidance, Quaffle Blocking, Field Awareness, Beater Aim, Rebounds","Chaser,Beater",,
Highway of Horror,Dodge bludgers; Field awareness; Quaffle block,"Cones are set up to create a lane approximately 3m wide and 8-10m long (longer if desired). Chasers, keepers, and seekers are put into two lines, one at each end of the lane. 2-3 beaters are positioned on the outside of the lane, each with a bludger. Non-beater positions must run through the lane without getting bludged; they may move within the lane but may not exit the lane. Chasers and keepers may have a quaffle while running if desired; seekers may not. At the end of the lane, the quaffle is handed off (if applicable) and the next person runs through in the opposite direction.","Skill-focus,Competitive",4,2,10,20,7,,"Dodging, Field Awareness, Quaffle Blocking, Agility","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
5 second pause,Learn where to set up on defense,"Every time possession changes during a scrimmage, blow the whistle. At this whistle, players who are now on defense have 5 seconds to run back and set up their defensive setup. Offensive players may not move from where they were when the whistle blew. After counting to 5 seconds, blow the whistle again and the offense is permitted to move. In the 5 second pause, the coach can call instruction or reminders for where to set up. The time of the pause may be changed; if players are new to defensive set up they may need a second or two more; if players are more experienced the pause may be reduced to 3 or 4 seconds.",Controlled scrimmage,2,1,15,30,10,,"Defensive Positioning, Teamwork, Field Awareness","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Heads down,Field awareness,"During the scrimmage, every minute or two, blow the whistle to stop play. When play is stopped all players must drop their brooms and close their eyes. The coach will then call out something for them to point to: the quaffle, the nearest opposing bludger, their nearest teammate of the same position, the snitch (if there is one), etc. Players must point and then when the coach allows them to, they may open their eyes and look where the person is. If they get the answer wrong, a punishment such as 5 pushups can be assigned.",Controlled scrimmage,2,1,15,30,10,,"Field Awareness, Communication, Positioning","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Ultimate quidditch,Learn to move into supporting positions; Learn to look for the pass,"Players may only take 3 steps with the quaffle, but are permitted to move as much as they would like if they're not carrying the quaffle. If a team has learned to look for the pass as soon as they get the quaffle, and players are always be moving into a position to receive a pass from the quaffle carrier, it should be near-impossible to tell that the team is playing with a restriction.",Controlled scrimmage,2,1,15,30,10,,"Passing, Positioning, Teamwork","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Seeker on the Pitch,Encourage seekers to work with beaters; Beater decision-making and communication with chasers,"During the scrimmage, put a snitch on the pitch. Call out an arbitrary point differential; teams must adjust their strategies accordingly. Goals do count towards changing the point differential (i.e. if the arbitrary differential was 'team A is down by 50', and then team A scores twice, they are now in snitch range). Every few stoppages of play, call out a new differential.",Controlled scrimmage,2,2,15,30,12,,"Strategic Adjustment, Beater-Seeker Coordination","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Pass to everyone,Encourage passing,"Before a team is allowed to score, each player must have possession of the quaffle. When explaining this drill, ensure you use the phrase 'have possession' rather than 'touch' - 'touch the quaffle' leaves the loophole of the keeper holding the quaffle in his or her zone and everyone putting a finger on it. A variation on this drill, depending on the attitude of your team, is that all goals must be either scored by or assisted by a non-male chaser or keeper.",Controlled scrimmage,2,1,15,30,10,,"Passing, Team Involvement, Communication","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
2 bludgers,Encourage passing and communication between beaters; Train one-bludger defense,"In this scrimmage, there are only two bludgers on pitch; each team may only have one. If one team recovers an extra bludger so they have two, the second must be rolled back to the other team. Beaters must communicate with the chasers to make a one-bludger defense work, and must communicate and with each other. Encourage beaters to pass the bludger between themselves or set up in a position where one can easily get the rebounds from the other.",Controlled scrimmage,2,2,15,30,10,,"Beater Communication, One-Bludger Defense, Team Strategy","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Side lanes,Discourage hero runs; encourage passing,"Cones are set up on the keeper zone line, 2m and 4m inside of the pitch boundary, to create lanes that are 2m wide. In order to enter the keeper zone, players must either pass across the keeper zone line at any point on the line, or run with the ball through the lanes at the side of the pitch.",Controlled scrimmage,2,2,15,30,10,,"Passing, Positioning, Strategy","Chaser,Beater,Keeper,Seeker",,
Tree practice,Bludger aim; Rebounds,"In a park or area with multiple trees, beaters pick a route and number of trees they must tap with their bludger in a specific order. They then must run and hit all the trees as quickly as possible, in the right order.","Skill-focus,Conditioning",1,1,5,15,1,,"Bludger Accuracy, Conditioning, Rebounds",Beater,,
Beater battles,Learning bludger rules; Catching; Bludger aim,"Beaters start in a brooms down position, facing each other, approximately 10m apart. Each beater has a bludger on the ground beside them. On 'Brooms up!' they must sprint to get the bludger next to the other beater, then attempt to knock out the other beater as quickly as possible.","Skill-focus,Competitive",2,2,5,15,2,,"Bludger Accuracy, Speed, Reaction Time",Beater,,
Firing squad,Bludger aim; Dodging; Catching,One beater stands in front of a fence/wall/other firm surface. The other beaters must attempt to hit them.

The target can be changed either every X minutes or every time they are hit.,"Skill-focus,Competitive",2,2,5,15,2,,"Bludger Accuracy, Dodging, Catching",Beater,,
Long target practice,Aiming and throwing long bludges,"There are three variations on this: Firstly, beaters simply pick a target on a wall or fence and attempt to hit the target from different distances. Secondly, beaters can take a partner and do 1-on-1 battles, simply farther apart. Thirdly, beaters take partners. Both beaters start at the same cone, and a second cone is set up approximately 10-12m away. The beater without a ball starts running, the beater with a ball can hit the beater without the ball once they get to the cone. This is to simulate a fast break in which a beater must turn and throw the ball back towards their hoops at a chaser running away from them.",Skill-focus,2,2,10,20,2,,"Long-Distance Accuracy, Reaction Time",Beater,,
1-on-1 battles (dodge then sprint for rebound),Rebounds; Bludger aim; Catching; Physicality,"Beaters work with a partner. One partner starts with the ball and must bludge the other partner. After the bludge (or attempted bludge), both players must attempt to get the rebound. Beaters may catch the bludger, or attempt to tackle the other beater in order to regain control of the bludger. Continue this drill for the desired length of time.","Skill-focus,Competitive,Contact",2,2,5,15,2,,"Bludger Accuracy, Rebounds, Physicality, Catching",Beater,,
Beware the Beaters,Understand seeker beating; Learn to work with seekers; Communication,"Four people mount brooms. Two people seek, two people beat. The four people are split up in two teams, each containing a seeker and a beater. Each team walks ten feet away from each other, in opposite directions, so that the teams end up 20 feet away from each other. In the middle, a referee sets down a bludger and a snitch waits. Then the ref walks to the side and yells 'Brooms up!' The seekers and beaters run to the middle. The beaters try to get the bludger and beat the opposing seeker, while the seekers try to catch the snitch. The drill ends when a seeker catches the snitch or is beat.","Skill-focus,Match-like situation",3,2,5,15,5,,"Seeker-Beater Coordination, Communication, Snitch Catching","Beater,Seeker",,
Keeper Drill,Improve keeper skills,"Set up three cones in a triangle formation about 5-7 meters apart. The keeper starts at one cone and must sprint to touch each of the other two cones before returning to the starting position. As soon as the keeper touches the starting cone, a chaser (positioned about 10 meters away) throws the quaffle at one of the three hoops. The keeper must then attempt to block the shot. Rotate chasers after each throw.",Skill-focus,3,2,10,20,2,,"Agility, Reaction Time, Shot Blocking","Keeper,Chaser",,
Chaser Passing Drill,Improve passing accuracy and speed,"Form a circle with 5-6 chasers, each about 5 meters apart. Start with one quaffle. Chasers must pass the quaffle to non-adjacent players in the circle as quickly and accurately as possible. After 30 seconds, add a second quaffle to increase difficulty. Coach can call out specific players who must receive the next pass to simulate game-like decision making.",Skill-focus,2,2,10,15,5,,"Passing Accuracy, Decision Making, Hand-Eye Coordination",Chaser,,
