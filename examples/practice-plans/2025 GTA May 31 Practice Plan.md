Position-specific warm up

**Chasers (and seekers)**

* 5-star passing. Start close with two handed passes. After each round, everyone takes a large step back and reverse directions  
* Passing to cutters (set cones).   
  * Some passes stationary, some passes while the thrower is on the move.

**Beaters**

* Paired (1B) warm up throws. Start light, ramp up, vary your throws (overhand, underhand, push). Step backs to increase range. Focus on hitting your target. Be specific with target practice (left shoulder, right knee, etc.)  
* All vs 1 skills. Dodge, block, catch, exchange

### 13:30 Drills

1.5 offence and defence (beaters) \- 30 minutes

**Notes:**  
Defence

- The default is 1 person blocking.  
- If offence gets past blocker, loaded beater may pass if unable to avoid contact  
  - If you pass, you are now blocking/protecting for your partner  
- The loaded beater can try more chill or aggro style defence.   
- If offence is poorly timed, tap beat the unloaded beater

Offence 

- Start with both beaters looking engaging and either can start the 1.5  
- Get more active with DB before initiating 1.5  
  - Tap beat on chaser or unloaded beater

How do we get the timing? 

- Chasers set a pick or a sharp pass at same time as 1.5  
- Call the play before starting the play. Call “Go\!” to initiate.   
  - “Maple on Golla” start 1.5 as soon as that player catches the ball

**Drills:**

Arkansas (like Oklahomas, but different) \[15 min\]

- One defensive free beater, one offensive engage, no dodgeballs.  
- Engage beater starts a little outside keeper zone, driving with the goal of tagging a hoop.  
- Free beater’s goal is to block engage beater, preventing or delaying their tag.  
- Learning objectives  
  - Defence: Figuring out your preferred blocking technique  
  - Offence: Lateral movement/juking and driving to get through 1.5 defence

Third-Courts (like half courts, but shorter) \[15 min\]

- Working through timing of 1.5 initiation and running through different positions  
- Two beaters without control on defence; two beaters with control \+ 2-3 ‘chasers’ on offence (dunks only)  
- Learning objectives  
  - Offence: Timing 1.5 initiation with your chaser offence; throwbacks to partner; free beater positioning and use/protection of dodgeballs  
  - Defence: Free beater 1.5 defence or reading the play to contest throwback; communication between partners on Free Beater’s objectives during 1.5; Engage beater positioning and movement to pressure offence

4 on 4 no beaters (chasers) \- 30 minutes  
[https://www.qdrill.app/drills/130](https://www.qdrill.app/drills/130) 

- No beaters for 30 seconds. Progress to 20, 15, 10, 5 seconds   
- Defence can attempt hoop zone  
- Offence encouraged to use picks, passes, and hand-offs  
- Offence must complete 6 good long range passes against an aggressive 2.2. Once 6 passes have been completed, they must dunk on the defence.

5 Min Break

### 15:15 \- Introduction to Aggressive Styles of Defence- 60 minutes

Aggro (2-2 but aggressive) \~ 10 min

More aggressive version of our defence, e.g. Aggro 2-2. Looking to use our advantages over the offence, forcing turnovers.

Press (start in 2-2, then aggress) \~ 15 min

Half court, offence beater whiffs a long beat attempt, defence has control. The other team has no DB. The beater forces the quaffle to pass. Chasers play a tight mark D, with one chaser on hoops. Free beater plays zone and is ready to help beat the next pass if needed.

Hero  (start in already aggressive defence) \~ 20 min

Half courts but offence starts at keeper line, defence starts in 2-2 positioning but with pre-communicated marks. Upon **“fly”**, beaters attempt to beat the ball carrier and the offensive loaded beater to force a pass, while chasers sprint to marks to try to intercept a pass. 

### 16:15 Scrimmages \- 45 minutes
