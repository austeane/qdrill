QDrill - AI-Developed Sports Practice Planning Platform

Duration: 1+ year (538 commits) | Tech Stack: SvelteKit, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Auth.js | 100% AI-Coded

A comprehensive web application for sports drill management and practice planning, developed entirely through AI pair programming without prior SvelteKit or full-stack experience. This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted development for complex applications.

Technical Achievements:
• Built 77 Svelte components and 14 API endpoints comprising ~100K lines of code
• Implemented sophisticated drag-and-drop system with timeline-based practice planning using custom Svelte stores
• Designed normalized PostgreSQL database schema with transaction support
• Integrated Google OAuth authentication with role-based permissions
• Created real-time collaborative features including voting, commenting, and drill variations

Complex Features Developed:
• Multi-section practice plan editor with parallel timeline visualization
• Advanced filtering system with performance optimization for large datasets
• Undo/redo functionality with full history tracking
• Wizard-based practice creation with duration management
• Responsive drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback

AI Development Highlights:
• Successfully architected modular component system without prior Svelte knowledge
• Implemented complex state management patterns using reactive stores
• Built production-ready API with proper error handling and SQL injection prevention
• Deployed on Vercel with CI/CD pipeline integration

This project showcases how AI tools can enable developers to build production-quality applications in unfamiliar technologies, managing complexity through iterative development and continuous learning.
