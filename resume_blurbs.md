## Version 1: Technical Achievement Focus

Developed QDrill, a full-stack sports coaching platform with 87,000+ lines of code and real users, without knowing any of the underlying technlogogies. This app has been used by Team Canada and has real users in the small market of quadball coaches. It includes complex features like real-time drag-and-drop practice planning, and a polished custom UI for viewing practices. I used AI for all of the code, working hard to maintain best coding practices in a language I didn't know.
