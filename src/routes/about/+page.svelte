        QDrill is created for coaches and athletes to create, organize, and share drills and practice plans.
      </p>
  
      <p class="mb-6">
        Quadball coaches are given the thankless task of running countless practices, often without guidance or support. QDrill is here to help.
      </p>
  
      <p class="mb-6">
        I hope that coaches from around the world create and share their drills and practice plans with the community through QDrill, pushing the sport forward for everyone.

        I'm a player and coach who would have loved to have this as a resource, so I built it.
