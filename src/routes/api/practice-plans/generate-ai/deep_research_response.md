Thanks! I’ll research the best practices, LLM models, libraries, and tooling for building an AI-generated practice plan feature in a Svelte app, particularly focusing on high-context LLM use (like your drill selection system) and UX improvements. I’ll include model comparisons (Claude Sonnet vs GPT-4 Turbo vs Gemini 1.5/2.5), optimal prompting techniques, enum-handling strategies, and helpful frontend/backend tools that could enhance this kind of AI-driven experience.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a structured set of recommendations.

# AI-Powered Practice Plan Generation: Models, Prompts, and Implementation Strategies

## Choosing the Right LLM Model for the Task

When generating structured practice plans from a large drill dataset (23k+ tokens and growing), the choice of language model is crucial. We need models with **large context windows** and strong adherence to output format instructions. Below is a comparison of top contenders as of 2025:

| **Model**                       | **Max Context Window**                               | **Structured Output Handling**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Notable Features & Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | **200k tokens** (Pro)                                | Excellent at following complex formatting instructions. In tests, it produced valid JSON for even very complex schemas almost flawlessly. No native JSON function API (requires prompt-based or “tool call” workaround).                                                                                          | Focused on safety and instruction-following; high reasoning ability. Introduced _Artifacts_ for interactive outputs (e.g. code or visualizations in chat).                                                              |
| **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (2024)**   | **128k tokens** (32k standard; 128k extended)        | Very reliable for structured output, especially using OpenAI’s **function calling / structured output API**. Will return clean JSON when a schema or function signature is provided. Pure prompt-based JSON formatting is also strong, though minor format errors can occur without the function call feature.    | Supports function calls that enforce JSON schema compliance, improving reliability. Widely accessible via API; proven track record in production use for structured data.                                               |
| **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**       | **128k** (standard); **2M tokens** with extended Pro | Good output quality but less straightforward to constrain. Google’s API uses a Schema proto for reliable JSON, which is cumbersome. Lacks easy field-level guidance, so the model might require very explicit prompting to avoid schema deviations.                                                               | Natively multimodal (text, images, audio). Offers **context caching** to reuse prompt tokens across calls. Can execute code in-line (e.g. run Python for reasoning). Best used via Google Cloud Vertex AI or AI Studio. |
| **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**       | **1M tokens** (2M coming soon)                       | Improved reasoning and format adherence over 1.5. Still uses similar schema enforcement via API as 1.5. Early reports show it maintains coherence even at very long contexts (minimal degradation). Likely to produce correct JSON if given clear instructions, but third-party dev tooling is still catching up. | State-of-the-art on many benchmarks. _“Thinking” model with chain-of-thought prompting built-in_. Multimodal and highly context-aware, suitable for complex planning tasks.                                             |

**Recommendations:** Given the requirements (long context and precise JSON output), **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and **GPT-4 Turbo** are both excellent choices. Claude’s huge 200k context can comfortably handle a growing drill library and follows instructions carefully (often outperforming GPT-4 in strict adherence tests). GPT-4 Turbo offers a more direct JSON schema integration – using OpenAI’s function calling, you can get a well-structured JSON response with minimal fuss. **Gemini 2.5** is a rising star with massive context and reasoning, but its integration for structured output is less developer-friendly at the moment. If you’re working within Google’s ecosystem or need multimodality, Gemini is worth exploring; otherwise, Claude or GPT-4 are currently more straightforward for JSON planning output.

## Prompt Design Best Practices for Structured JSON Output

Designing the prompt properly is essential to avoid formatting errors (e.g. enum mismatches or extra text) and to ensure the LLM returns a clean JSON practice plan. Key strategies include:

- **Explicit Instructions:** Clearly instruct the model that the **output must be JSON only**, following a specified schema. For example, you might use a system message like: _“You are a coaching assistant. Output the practice plan as a JSON object **exactly** in the following format…”_. Emphasize that no extra commentary should be added. Being upfront that the JSON will be parsed by a program can improve compliance. For instance, _“Ensure the output is valid JSON; it will be parsed with `json.loads()`”_.

- **Schema or Template Provision:** Provide the JSON **structure or a template** in the prompt. You can list the required keys, value types, and even example placeholder values. For example, include a mini-template:

  ```json
  {
  	"sections": [
  		{
  			"name": "<Section Name>",
  			"activities": [{ "drillId": "<ID>", "details": "<...>" }]
  		}
  	]
  }
  ```

  This acts as a guide. Instruct the model that all keys and nesting should match this format. This reduces the chance of missing fields or misnaming them.

- **Enumerated Values Guidance:** If certain fields have **enumerated allowed values** (e.g. skillLevel = {"Beginner","Intermediate","Advanced"}), explicitly mention these and stress that the model must use one of them exactly. For example: _“Use `"skillLevel"` as one of: `"Beginner"`, `"Intermediate"`, or `"Advanced"` – no other values are allowed.”_ This helps prevent the model from inventing synonyms or variations that would break your schema (a known issue where an LLM produces a valid JSON but with unexpected values).

- **Few-Shot Examples:** Providing a **concrete example** of an input and the desired JSON output can dramatically improve reliability. For instance, show a short dummy practice plan for a dummy input. This example will anchor the model’s formatting. Make sure your example output JSON is perfectly formatted (the model might mimic any errors in it).

- **Temperature and Style:** Use a relatively _low temperature_ setting (e.g. 0 to 0.3) during generation. A lower temperature reduces randomness, making the output more deterministic and likely to stick to the format. Also consider turning off certain creative features (if the API has those options) to avoid the model adding narratives or explanations. In all prompts, reiterate that **no explanatory text** or conversation should precede or follow the JSON – the response should be _pure JSON_.

- **OpenAI Function Calling (if using GPT-4):** Take advantage of function calling to enforce structure. Define a function (e.g. `createPracticePlan`) with a proper JSON schema for the plan. GPT-4 will then output a JSON payload for that function. This bypasses many formatting issues since the model knows it _must_ return a JSON object that fits the schema. For example, using the OpenAI Node SDK, you might do:

  ```typescript
  const functions = [{
    name: "createPracticePlan",
    description: "Generate a sports practice plan as JSON",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        sections: { /* define structure for sections and activities */ }
      },
      required: ["sections"]
    }
  }];
  const res = await openai.createChatCompletion({
    model: "gpt-4-32k",
    messages: [ {...} ],
    functions,
    function_call: { name: "createPracticePlan" }
  });
  const jsonPlan = JSON.parse(res.data.choices[0].message!.function_call!.arguments);
  ```

  This guarantees a structured JSON response (or an error if the model somehow deviates). **Claude 3.5** doesn’t have an exact equivalent, but Anthropic suggests a “formatting trick” using its tools API: essentially instructing Claude to treat the JSON as a tool output. If using Claude via an API that supports this, it can improve reliability. Otherwise, prompt-based enforcement (as above) is needed.

By combining these techniques – explicit schema, enumerated value lists, low creativity, and possibly function calling – you can greatly reduce issues like missing fields or invalid JSON. In essence, **be as explicit and restrictive in the prompt as possible, while still describing the flexibility the model has** (for example, it can choose any drills, but must format them in a given JSON structure).

## Backend Improvements: Validation, Schema Enforcement, and Fallbacks

On the server side (SvelteKit backend), implementing robust validation and fallback logic will make the AI feature production-grade.

- **JSON Schema Validation:** After receiving the LLM’s response, always **validate the JSON** against your expected schema. This catches any deviations or errors that slipped through. You can use libraries like **Ajv** (for JSON Schema validation) or **Zod** (if you prefer TypeScript schema definitions) to programmatically verify the output. For example, define a schema for the practice plan and check the LLM output:

  ```typescript
  import { practicePlanSchema } from './schemas'; // e.g., Zod schema
  const parsed = practicePlanSchema.safeParse(aiOutput);
  if (!parsed.success) {
  	// handle validation errors...
  }
  ```

  This ensures that required fields (like `sections` or `drillId`) are present and that all values conform (e.g., `skillLevel` is one of the allowed enums). According to industry findings, LLMs can sometimes produce a structurally valid JSON that **does not match the exact schema or data model** expected – e.g., wrong keys or value types. Validation will catch that.

- **Automated Repair Strategies:** If validation fails, you can implement a repair loop. One approach is to **call the LLM again with the error feedback** – e.g., “The JSON you provided is invalid because: <error>. Please output a corrected JSON.” Many models (GPT-4, Claude) will correct themselves on a second try. Another approach is to use a lightweight parser or regex to fix common issues (e.g., add a missing quote or remove trailing commas) if the errors are minor formatting ones. Libraries like **Guardrails AI** can automate this process: Guardrails will check the output against a schema and either fix it or re-prompt the model to correct itself. This library has both Python and JavaScript integrations and can save time writing custom validation/correction logic.

- **Fallback Responses:** Have a plan for absolute failure cases. If after a couple of attempts the model cannot produce a valid plan, the system could either:

  - Return a **friendly error message** to the user (asking them to adjust input or try again later).
  - Or provide a **basic generated plan** from a deterministic template as a fallback. For instance, your code could randomly select a few drills from each category to assemble a rudimentary plan. This ensures the user always gets _something_ usable, even if it’s not AI-tailored. Given the high reliability of modern models, this should be rare, but it's good practice for resilience.

- **Efficiency with Large Drill Data:** Including the full 23k-token drill list in every prompt is expensive and slow. On the backend, consider improvements such as:

  - **Vectorized Drill Retrieval:** Pre-compute embeddings for each drill description and use a vector database or similarity search (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or even a local library with cosine similarity) to fetch the top relevant drills for the user’s query. For example, if the user’s focus is "shooting drills" and skill "beginner", you might retrieve the 50 most relevant drills and feed only those to the prompt, instead of all drills. This keeps the prompt size manageable as the drill library grows.
  - **Context Caching:** If using models like Gemini via their API, take advantage of context caching mechanisms. For instance, you might store a reference to the large static drill list in the model’s long-term context (if the API allows) so you don’t need to resend it on every request. This is a newer technique that can drastically cut down token usage and latency by reusing tokens across calls.

By validating the output and optimizing the context usage, the backend becomes more robust. It will catch and handle model errors gracefully and scale better as your data grows.

## Frontend Interface Enhancements (UX & Mobile-Friendliness)

The user interface is where coaches or athletes will interact with this AI feature, so focusing on clarity and responsiveness is key:

- **Form-Based Input:** Since the model needs structured inputs (goals, focus areas, skill level, duration, participant count), present these as a clear form. Use appropriate controls: e.g. dropdowns or radio buttons for enumerated fields like skill level or focus area (to avoid users typing unexpected values), number pickers for duration or participant count, etc. This not only improves UX but also guarantees the backend receives clean, valid inputs.

- **Clear Call-to-Action:** Have a prominent "Generate Practice Plan" button or similar, so it's obvious how to submit the form. The user should understand that clicking it will produce an AI-generated plan.

- **Loading State & Feedback:** AI generation may take a few seconds (especially with large models). Implement a visible loading indicator or progress message. For example, a spinner with text like "Generating your practice plan...". This assures users the system is working. On SvelteKit, you can bind a state variable like `loading = true` when the request starts and set it to false when results arrive, to control a loading overlay or spinner component.

- **Desktop vs Mobile Layout:** Design **responsive layouts** that adapt to screen size. A common approach is to use a two-column layout on desktop (left side for inputs, right side for the output plan), but stack these vertically on mobile. Using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS (with SvelteKit) or a Svelte UI kit (e.g. Flowbite Svelte or Skeleton) can simplify this. For example, on wide screens you might show:

  ```html
  <div class="flex">
  	<div class="w-1/3 p-4"><!-- input form --></div>
  	<div class="w-2/3 p-4"><!-- output display --></div>
  </div>
  ```

  And on smaller screens, these divs would stack (Tailwind’s utility classes or CSS media queries can handle this). Prioritize a mobile-friendly design with adequate spacing, larger touch targets for form inputs, and avoid any fixed-width elements that would overflow on small screens.

- **Displaying the Plan:** Once the JSON plan is returned, format it for readability. Most users won’t want to see raw JSON. You can transform it into an organized list or sections:

  - Each **section** in the plan can be a heading or card, with the section name and perhaps duration if included.
  - Under each section, list the **drills/activities**. If you have a mapping of `drillId` to drill details (name/description), show the name of the drill and maybe a short description or key points. This makes the plan immediately understandable.
  - Consider making each drill item expandable (e.g., tap to show more details like instructions). This keeps the interface clean, especially on mobile, where you could collapse long descriptions under an accordion.
  - Provide an option to **download or copy** the plan. A “Copy JSON” button or “Download as JSON/CSV” could be useful for users who want to tweak the plan or save it.

- **Interactivity and Refinement:** A nice UX touch is to allow users to **refine or regenerate** easily. Maybe after seeing the plan, the user wants more focus on a certain skill – you could let them adjust the inputs and re-run. Ensure the previous inputs are preserved in the form for quick tweaks. Also, if partial editing of the AI output is allowed (maybe the user deletes one drill and wants the AI to fill that gap), it could be a future enhancement to support _plan editing_. Initially, a simpler regenerate-with-new-prompts approach is fine.

- **Mobile Performance:** Test the interface on actual mobile devices. Large JSON objects or long lists can sometimes be heavy. Use Svelte’s reactive updates smartly to avoid blocking the UI. For example, if the output JSON is huge, you might render it in chunks or use virtualization for very long lists. Given typical practice plans won’t be extremely long, this is usually okay. But keep an eye on it as the drill content grows.

In summary, focus on a **clean, responsive design**: easy inputs, clear loading feedback, and a nicely formatted result. This ensures the AI feature feels integrated and user-friendly, rather than just a raw JSON dump. Small touches like animations on state change, tooltips explaining each input field, and consistent styling will make the tool look professional.

## Useful Tools & Libraries for Integration

Building this with SvelteKit, you can leverage a number of libraries to speed up development and improve reliability:

- **Vercel AI SDK:** The Vercel AI SDK is a popular choice for building AI-powered apps in TypeScript, and it supports SvelteKit out of the box. This SDK provides:

  - A **unified API** to call various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with minimal config changes.
  - Built-in support for **streaming responses**, so if you ever stream tokens for partial results, it handles the event stream parsing for you.
  - Utilities like `generateObject()` which can directly return a typed JSON object from the model. This is particularly useful: you provide a schema or TypeScript interface, and the SDK will manage the prompt and parsing to give you a ready-to-use object.
  - In short, it abstracts a lot of boilerplate. Given the rapid iteration on the SDK, it’s a highly recommended addition that many developers credit for speeding up their AI feature development.

- **Schema Validation Libraries:** As noted, **Zod** (for a TS-first approach) or **Ajv** (for JSON schemas) are great for validating LLM output on the backend. They also can serve double-duty for validating user input on the server, and ensuring your internal data structures remain consistent. Zod can generate TypeScript types from schemas (or vice versa), which is handy for type-safe development.

- **Guardrails AI:** For a more advanced control, Guardrails (open-source) can be integrated to enforce output **structure and quality**. You define a rail (in JSON or XML format) describing the allowed format, value ranges, etc., and wrap your LLM call with it. Guardrails will intercept the LLM output and automatically correct or retry as needed until it meets the spec. This can be overkill for some cases, but if you find yourself needing very high reliability or dealing with frequent format issues, it’s a powerful tool. The JavaScript version `guardrails-js` can be used in a SvelteKit backend.

- **Svelte UI Libraries:** To speed up frontend development, consider using component libraries:

  - **Flowbite Svelte** (Tailwind-based) or **Skeleton** can provide ready-made components (forms, cards, accordions, navbars) that are responsive and consistent. This saves you from writing a lot of CSS from scratch.
  - **Svelte Headless UI** is another option if you want unstyled accessible components that you can style yourself. And **SvelteStrap** (Bootstrap for Svelte) or **Svelte Material UI** offer more traditional UI looks. Any of these can help ensure your app looks polished and works on different screen sizes.

- **Logging and Analytics:** Since this is a user-facing AI feature, adding logging can be invaluable. Using SvelteKit’s server hooks or API routes, log the prompts and model responses (with user consent) in a secure database or even just server logs. This will help in debugging when something goes wrong. Analytics on which drills are frequently selected or which inputs are common could inform future improvements (and can be part of a feedback loop system).

- **Deployment Considerations:** You mentioned Vercel – note that SvelteKit on Vercel will run serverless functions. Keep an eye on execution time, as very large context LLM calls can be slow. If you anticipate calls nearing Vercel’s default function timeout, you might need to enable streaming responses or look into Vercel’s Edge functions (though heavy LLM calls may not be suitable for Edge). Alternatively, you could offload the AI generation to a background job or a separate service if needed. For now, as long as the LLM responds within, say, 10-15 seconds, a serverless function should handle it.

In essence, you have a rich ecosystem of AI dev tools in 2025. The combination of **Vercel’s AI SDK** for front-end/back-end integration and **strong validation libraries** for correctness will cover most bases. Surround that with a good UI kit and logging, and you’ll significantly enhance the developer experience and reliability of your application.

## Future Expansion and Generalization Ideas

Once the core system is working, there are exciting ways to expand and improve the AI practice plan generator:

- **Fine-Tuning or Custom Models:** As you gather data on practice plans and user preferences, consider fine-tuning an LLM to specialize in this task. For instance, OpenAI might allow fine-tuning GPT-4 Turbo in the future, or GPT-3.5 (with 16k context) could be fine-tuned on a large set of goal->plan examples. Fine-tuning can make the model more deterministic and aligned with your specific domain (sports coaching) vocabulary. Alternatively, an open-source model (like Llama 2 or other large context local models) could be fine-tuned and run on your own infrastructure to reduce dependency on external APIs. This could also let you embed the drills knowledge in the model weights, reducing the need to pass the full drill list each time. Keep an eye on emerging models that are efficient and support long context – by 2025, there are many research efforts on **efficient 30-70B parameter models with 100k+ context**.

- **User Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism where users can rate or tweak the generated plans. For example, after a practice session, a coach might rate the overall plan or rate individual drills on usefulness. This data is gold for improving the system:

  - Short term, you can feed high-rated vs low-rated drill usage back into the model prompt. E.g., “The user preferred drills A and B last time, so prioritize similar drills.”
  - Long term, you can use the feedback dataset to train a reward model or to fine-tune the plan generator to optimize for user satisfaction (a form of reinforcement learning with human feedback, RLHF).
  - Even without training, simply tracking drill popularity can let you **weight the random selection**. You might ensure frequently praised drills show up more, and drills with poor feedback are used less or eventually removed/replaced.

- **Drill Metadata & Constraints:** Expand the drill JSON with more metadata that the AI can use. If not already present, you could add tags like `sport`, `difficulty`, `equipment needed`, etc. This would allow the user to specify constraints (like “I only have cones and a goal, no other equipment” or “indoor drills only”) and the model can filter drills accordingly. This moves towards a more generalized planning system where the AI can handle constraints and complex preferences. Modern models with large context should be able to handle these additional instructions as long as the prompt is well-structured (you might include the metadata in the drills list passed in context).

- **Multi-Domain Expansion:** The same framework could be extended beyond sports. For example, one could feed it a library of **workout exercises** and create personalized gym workout plans, or a library of **teaching activities** to generate lesson plans. By abstracting the concept (drills/exercises as building blocks, sessions as structured plans), your system could evolve into a generic planner. This might entail fine-tuning the model on multiple domains or maintaining separate prompt templates per domain.

- **Real-Time Collaboration or Agent Features:** For a future version, imagine a more interactive planning assistant. A user might chat with the AI: “Can we make the warm-up shorter?” or “I want to focus more on dribbling today.” The AI could then adjust the JSON plan dynamically. Achieving this might require an agent-like approach where the AI keeps the plan in memory (or in an artifact, if using Claude’s interface) and modifies it based on instructions. This is more advanced, but tools like the function-calling API or code-execution features (in Gemini) could be leveraged to let the model effectively call a “update_plan(plan, instruction)” function.

- **Quality Assurance for Drill Content:** As the drill database grows (possibly crowd-sourced or expanded), ensure to maintain quality. You might integrate an AI to **rate or summarize new drills** added to the system, or to flag duplicates. This helps keep the suggestions top-notch. Additionally, you could use LLMs to **generate variations of drills** (augmenting your dataset) which a coach can review and approve, thus expanding the content without purely manual authoring.

In conclusion, you have a solid starting point: a large-context model to assemble practice plans. By selecting the right model (Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini) and enforcing structure via prompt and validation, you’ll get reliable outputs. From there, focusing on user experience in the SvelteKit app will make the tool approachable for coaches. With robust back-end checks and some helpful libraries, the system will be maintainable and scalable. And as user adoption grows, leveraging feedback and possibly fine-tuning will turn the tool into an even smarter, more personalized coaching assistant. The field is moving fast, so continuing to watch developments (new model releases, improved SDKs, and community best practices) will ensure your solution remains state-of-the-art.
