# Ticket 24: Conduct Systematic Accessibility (A11y) Review

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Issue:** The initial review noted potential accessibility concerns in several areas, but a systematic review is needed.
    - Modals (`DrillSearchModal`, `EmptyCartModal`, `TimelineSelectorModal`, `FeedbackModal`): Focus trapping, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes (`aria-modal`, `role="dialog"`, labels).
    - Custom Controls (`ThreeStateCheckbox`): Needs proper ARIA roles/states (`role="checkbox"`, `aria-checked`) and keyboard interaction.
    - General: Semantic HTML usage, color contrast, keyboard navigation for interactive elements (like drag/drop handles, custom buttons/dropdowns).
- **Affected Files:** Potentially many components, including:
    - `src/components/practice-plan/modals/*.svelte`
    - `src/components/FeedbackModal.svelte`
    - `src/components/ThreeStateCheckbox.svelte`
    - `src/components/FilterPanel.svelte`
    - Components involved in drag/drop (`DrillItem.svelte`, etc.)
    - `src/components/Cart.svelte`
- **Recommendations:**
    - Conduct a thorough accessibility audit using automated tools (e.g., Axe DevTools) and manual testing (keyboard navigation, screen reader checks).
    - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and have clear focus indicators.
    - Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate.
    - Add necessary ARIA attributes to custom components/widgets to convey their role, state, and properties to assistive technologies.
    - Verify sufficient color contrast.
    - Ensure focus is managed correctly within modals and dynamic UI sections.
