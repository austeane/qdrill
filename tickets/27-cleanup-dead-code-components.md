# Ticket 27: Remove Unused Components

**Priority:** Low

**Description:** The codebase contains Svelte components that appear to be unused remnants from examples or previous development phases. Removing this dead code improves maintainability and reduces clutter.

**Affected Files:**

*   [`src/routes/Counter.svelte`](src/routes/Counter.svelte) (Likely example code)
*   Potentially others identified during a systematic dead code analysis.

**Related Notes:**

*   [`code-review/routes-base-notes.md`](code-review/routes-base-notes.md)
*   [`code-review/holistic-summary.md`](code-review/holistic-summary.md)

**Action Required:**

1.  Verify that [`src/routes/Counter.svelte`](src/routes/Counter.svelte) is indeed unused (check for imports/references).
2.  If unused, delete the component file.
3.  Conduct a broader search for other potentially unused components (e.g., using code analysis tools or manual checks) and remove them if confirmed.
