Changes to home page

I'm doing a ux/ui based redesign of my app. Here is what should change in the home page. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I would like this to still be great on mobile, and would like to use tailwind as much as possible, though custom css is fine if necessary.

Current Design :
Header:
Simple navigation bar at the top with links: "Home," "Drill Listing," "Drill Creation," "Bulk Drill Upload," and "Practice Plans."
The logo is on the left side of the navigation bar.
Body:
A large title that reads "Welcome to QDrill."
A brief description: "Your ultimate tool for creating and managing drills."
Footer:
Contains links to "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service."
A floating blue button with a cart icon in the bottom right.

Proposed Design:
Header:
A redesigned navigation bar with a home icon on the left side and two menu items on the right: "Drills" and "Practice Plans."
A shopping cart icon is in the upper-right corner, indicating an e-commerce-style component.
Body:
A bold title: "QDrill."
Placeholder text underneath the title: "Insert blurb text about what QDrill is all about."
A button labeled "Browse List of Drills" is directly under the blurb.
A large gray rectangle to the right of the title and blurb, with placeholder shapes (triangles, squares, and circles) meant to represent some visual content (e.g., a diagram, illustration, or featured drill design).
Below the main title area, there are three large buttons or cards arranged horizontally:
Practice Plans card: Includes some placeholder text and a link that says "View Plans."
Create New Drill card: Includes similar placeholder text and a link that says "Create Drill."
About Us card: Placeholder text and a link to a page labeled "Go to Page."
Implementation Details:
To implement these changes, here’s a step-by-step guide for someone familiar with front-end development but not looking at the screenshots:

1. Navigation Bar Updates:
Before: The navigation bar spans the entire width, with all links (Home, Drill Listing, etc.) spread horizontally.
After: Simplify the navigation by using an icon (e.g., home icon on the left) and condensing menu items to the right side ("Drills," "Practice Plans").
Shopping Cart Icon: Add a cart icon to the top-right corner to replace the floating cart button from the original design.
2. Body Section Layout:
Before: The homepage is minimalist, with only a large text header and subheader, centered in the page.
After: Introduce a more visually structured layout:
Title Section:
Keep the title "QDrill" in bold, followed by descriptive text about the app.
Add a primary action button labeled “Browse List of Drills” directly below the blurb text.
Introduce a large placeholder graphic area to the right of the title, consisting of simple shapes. This can be an SVG or image block intended for later graphics or app features.
3. New Action Cards:
Before: No cards or call-to-action sections exist.
After: Introduce a new section of the homepage with three horizontally aligned cards or buttons:
Card 1: Label it "Practice Plans," with a link directing users to a page that allows them to view practice plans. Add some explanatory text.
Card 2: Label it "Create New Drill," similarly with a call-to-action for users to create a drill. Add placeholder text.
Card 3: Label it "About Us," with a link directing to the about page. Placeholder text in the description.
4. Footer:
The footer remains similar to the previous version with links like "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service." It may no longer need a floating button, as the shopping cart is now in the header.
Summary of Key Changes:
Shift from a minimalist design to a more content-rich homepage.
Simplified navigation with more visual organization, using cards and action buttons to direct users.
Addition of placeholders for future graphics and improved user engagement through multiple calls to action (drill browsing, creation, practice plans).
